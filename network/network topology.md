# Network topology

## What is a network topology?

A network topology is the physical and logical arrangment of nodes and connections in a network. Nodes usually include devices such as switches, routes and software with switch and router features. Network topologies are often represented as a graph.

Network topologies describe the arrangment of networks and the relative location of traffic flows. Administrators can use network topology diagrams to determine the best placements for each node and the optimal path for traffic flow. With a well-defined and planned-out network topology, an organization can more easily locate faults and fix issues, improving its data transfer efficiency.

Network geometry can be defined as the physical topology and the logical topology.

Network topology: Star, Ring, Mesh, Bus, Tree.

**Bus network.** In the Bus network topology, every node is connected in series along a single cable.

**Star network.** In the star network topology, a central device connects to all other nodes through a central hub. Switched local area networks based on Ethernet switches and most wired home and office networks have a physical star topology. 

**Ring network.** In the ring network topology, the nodes are connected in a closed-loop configuration. Some rings pass data in one direction only, while others are capable of transmission in both directions. These bidirection ring networks are more resilient than bus networks since traffic can reach a node by moving in either direction. Metro networks based on Synchronous Optimal Network technology are the primary example of ring networks.

**Mesh network.** The mesh network topology links nodes with connections so that multiple paths between at least points of the network are available. A network is considered to be fully meshed if all nodes are directly connected to other nodes. Meshing multiple paths increases resilient but also increases cost.

**Tree network.** The tree network topology consists of one root node, and all other nodes are connected in a hierarchy. Topology itself is connected is a star configuration. Many large Ethernet switch networks, including data center networks, are configured as trees.
