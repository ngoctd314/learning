### Computer Networks - Basic Characteristics

A computer network is a set of **nodes** connected by **communication links**.

- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending/receiving data generated by other nodes in the network.

Example of nodes: Computer, Server, Printer, Switches, Bridges, Routers etc...

- A communication link can be a wired link or wireless link.

**Outcomes**

Upon the completion of this session, the learner will be able to

- Know "What is Data Communication?"
- Understand data flow

- Know the elements of protocol

#### Data Communication

- Data communications are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of links (transimission medium) such as a cable.

#### Data Flow

Data flow means the data is going to flow from one node to another node.

- Simplex

Communication is always unidirectional <br>
One device can transmit <br>
Example: Keyboards, Trandition monitors <br>

- Half Duplex

Communication is in both directions but not at the same time.<br>
If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.<br>

- Full Duplex
Communication is in both directions simultaneously.<br>
Device can send and receive at the same time.<br>
Example: Telephone line.<br>

**Protocols**

All communication schemes will have the following things in common:

- Source or sender
- Destination or receiver
- Channel or media

Rules or protocols govern all methods of communication.

Protocol=Rule

It is a set of rules that govern data communication.

Protocol determines:
- What is communicated?
- How it is communicated?
- When it is communicated?

Protocols used in network communications also define:

- Message encoding
- Message formatting and encapsulation
- Message timing
- Message size
- Message delivery options

|IP Address|MAC Address|
|-|-|
|Needed for communication|Needed for communication|
|32 bits|48 bits|
|Represented in Decimal|Represented in hexadecimal|
|Router needs IP address to forward data|Switches needs MAC address to forward data|

### Basic of Port Addressing

**Derivations from analogy**

Reaching our city = Reaching our network (IP Address)<br>
Reaching our Apartment = Reaching the host (MAC Address)<br>
Reaching the right person = Reaching the right process (Port Address)<br>

**Port Address Or Port Number**

- In a node, many process will be running.
- Data which are sent/received must reach the right process.
- Every process in a node in uniquely identified using port number.
- Port = Communication endpoint.
- Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers (0 - 65535)

**3 Key Points To Ponder**

Before sending the data, any node must

- Attach source IP address and destination IP address.

### Switching Techniques

**Outcomes**

- Understand switching.
- Understand various switching techniques such as circuit switching message switching and packet switching.

**Switching**

- Switching in computer network helps in deciding the best route for data transimission if there are multiple paths in a large network.
- One-to-one connection.

**Switching Techniques**

Switching techniques 

- Circuit Switching
    - A dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver.
    - Before data transfer, connection will be established first.

- Message Switching
    - Store and forward mechanism
    - Message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using store and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
    - Not suited for streaming and real-time applications.
- Packet Switching
    - Datagram Approach
    - Virtual Circuit Approach

**Packet Switching**

- The internet is a packet switched network.
- Message is broken into individual chunks called as packets.
- Each packet is sent individually.
- Each packet will have source and destination IP address with sequence number.
- Sequence numbers will help the receiver to
    - Reorder the packets
    - Detect missing packets and
    - Send acks

1. Datagram approach

- Datagram Packet Switching is also known as connectionless switching. 
- Each independent entity is called as datagram.
- Datagrams contain destination information and the intermediary devices uses this information to forward datagrams to right destination.
- In Datagram Packet Switching approach, the path is not fixed.
- Intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward the packets.

2. Virtual Circuit Approach

- Virtual Circuit Switching is also known as connection-oriented switching.
- In the case of VCA, a preplanned route is established before the message are sent.
- Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connection between sender and receiver.
- In this approach, the path is fixed for the duration of a logical connection.

    - These are the bridge in which the stations are completely unaware of the bridge's existence.
    - Reconfiguration of the stations is unnecessary even if bridge is added or removed from network.

- Source Routing Bridges
    - In these bridges, routing operation is performed by source station and the frame specifies which route to follow.

**Working of Bridge**

Lan1 -> Bridge -> Lan2

A very important point to note about bridge that two network running the same protocol.

If bridge can connect to LAN, router also can connected to LAN. Then what is the different between them.

Router connect two different LAN.

When network layer create the packet it give that packet to data link layer in order to add header and trailer. After adding header and trailer => call packet is frame.

Data link layer is responsible for moving data (frames) from one node to another node.

**Services provided by data link layer**

- Framing
- Physical Addressing
- Flow Control
- Error Control
- Access Control

**Framing**

- The data link layer needs to pack bits into frames, so that each frame is distinguishable from another.
- Our postal system practices a type of framing.
- The simple act of inserting a letter into an envelop separates one piece of information from another; the envelop serves as the delimiter.

**Physical Addressing**

- A frame is the encapsulation of the header and trailer information with the packet.
- In the header, the source and the destination MAC address are dealt.

- Each VLAN is a broadcast domain, usually with its own IP network.
- VLANs are mutually isolated and packets can only pass between them via a router.
- The partition of the Layer 2 network takes place inside a Layer 2 device, usually via a switch.

- It is used to properly transmit multiple VLAN frames through a trunk link.
- Switches tag frames to identify the VLAN to that they belong. Different tagging protocols exist.
- The protocol defines the structure of the tagging header added to the frame.
