# Basic linux command

## pgrep in linux

The `pgrep` command is Linux is used to search for a progress by its name and other attributes and print the process ID (PID) to the standard output. Here's the basic syntax:

```sh
pgrep [options] pattern
```

- `options`: Additional flags and options to customize the behavior.
- `pattern`: The pattern or name used to search for processes.

Here are some common examples:

**1. Search for a Process by Name**

```sh
pgrep firefox
```

This command searches for the process with the name `firefox` and prints its PID.

**2. Search for a Process by Full Command Line**

```sh
pgrep -f "java -jar myapp.jar"
```

The `-f` option allows you to search for a process by its full command line.

**3. Search for a Process Owned by a Specific User**

```sh
pgrep -u username
```

Replace `username` with the actual username. This command finds processes owned by the specified user.

**4. Count the Number of Processes Matching a Pattern**

```sh
pgrep -c nginx
```

The `-c` option counts the number of processes that match the pattern "nginx" instead of printing the PIDs. 

**5. Print Detailed Information about Processes**

```sh
pgrep -fl ssh
```

**6. Case-Insensitive Search**

```sh
pgrep -i apache
```

The `-i` option makes the search case-insensitive.

These are just a few examples, and there are more options available. You can check the manual page for `pgrep` by using:

```sh
man pgrep
```

## xargs in Linux

`xargs` is used to build and execute command lines from standard input. It reads items from the standard input, typically separated by spaces or newlines, and executes a command for each item. It is derived from the words "argument list" and is designed to take input from standard input (stdin) and convert it into command-line arguments for another command. The primary purpose of `xargs` is to build and execute command lines from the output of another command.

The `xargs` command is particular useful when you want to apply a command to a list of items obtained from another command or from a file, and you need to handle cases where the list might be too long for a single command line or when the items are separated by spaces, newlines, or other delimiters.

```sh
command | xargs [options] [command [initial-arguments]]
```

- `command`: The command to execute for each item.
- `options`: Additional options that modify the behavior of `xargs`.
- `initial-arguments`:
