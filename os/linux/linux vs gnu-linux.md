The terms "GNU/Linux" and "Linux" are often used interchangeable, but the refer to sightly different concepts within the context of open-source operating systems:

**1. Linux**

- **Kernel:** "Linux" refers to Linux kernel, which is the core component of the operating system. The kernel is responsible for managing hardware resources, memory, processes and providing the essential functionality for an operating system to run.

- **Incomplete OS:** When people say "Linux", they are often referring to the Linux kernel plus a collection of software and utilities (known as userland or userspace tools) that make up a complete operating system.

**2. GNU/Linux**

- **Complete Operating System:** "GNU/Linux" refers to a complete operating system that includes the Linux kernel and a substantial set of software and utilities provided by the GNU Project. The GNU Project is a collection of free and open-source software initiated by Richard Stallman in the early 1980s.

- **Collaboration:** GNU/Linux emphasizes the collaborative effort of combining the Linux kernel with the GNU software to create a fully function and free (as in freedom) operating system. The GNU utilities provide essential tools like the shell, text editors, compilers, and more.
