# Linux: A Frist View

Linux has four major parts:

**The kernel**
The low-level operating system, handling files, disks, networking, and other necessities we take for granted. Most users rarely notice the kernel.

**Supplied programs**
Thousands of programs for file manipulation, text editing...

**The shell**
A user interface for typing commands, executing them, and displaying the results

**X**
A graphical system that provides windows, menus, icons, mouse support and other familiar GUI element. More complex graphical enviroments are built on X; the most popular are KDE and GNOME. We'll discuss only a few programs that open X windows to run.

For an applicatoin called Terminal, Konsole, xterm or something similar. Launch this program to open a shell window.

The window program (Terminal, Konsole) is not the shell. It's just a graphical program - possibly with fancy features of its own - that runs a shell on your behalf. The shell is what prompts you for commands and runs them.

Graphic use case:
User -> Terminal -> Shell -> Linux OS

Non graphic use case:
User -> Shell -> Linux OS
