IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three types of cloud service models. IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service provides users with a resource-based service via virtualization technology, offering computing infrastructure, physical or (more often) virtual machines and other resources.

PaaS or Platform as a Service provides runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applications, it is utililzed for software development and offers a platform to developers to build applications and services over the internet.

SaaS or Software as a Service provides on-demand software accessed via the internet, it delivers a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basic from a cloud service provider.
