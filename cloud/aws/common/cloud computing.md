# What is Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet instead of using local servers. It offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services which include data storage, databases, applications, analytics... The biggest names providing cloud computing services are AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others. The main sellling point is that you only pay for the services you see, helping you manage your expenses more effectively.

Cloud computing is a technology model that allows access to and delivery of computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence) over the internet, often referred to as "the cloud". Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and infrastructure, users can leverage cloud services to run applications, store data, and perform various computing tasks without the need for on-premises hardware.

Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

- On-Demand Self-Service: Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed, without requiring human intervention from service providers.
- Broad Network Access: Cloud services are accessible over the internet from a variety of devices
