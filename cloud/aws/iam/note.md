# AWS Identity and Access Management

AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

## What is IAM

### When do I use IAM

1. When you are performing different job functions
2. When you are authorized to access AWS resources
3. When you sign-in as an IAM user
4. When you assume an IAM role
5. When you create policies and permissions

### How IAM works

IAM provides the infrastructure necessary to control authentication and authorization for your AWS account.

#### Terms

1. IAM Resources: The user, group, role, policy, and identity provider objects that are stored in IAM. As with other AWS services, you can add, edit, and remove resources from IAM.
2. IAM Identities: The IAM resource objects that are used to identify and group. You can attach a policy to an IAM identity. These include users, groups and roles.
3. IAM Entities: The IAM resource object that AWS uses for authentication. These include IAM users and roles
4. Principals: A person or application that uses the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role to sign in and make requests to AWS.
5. Human users: Also known as human identities; the people, administrators, developers, operators, and consumers of your applications.
6. Workload: A collection of resources and code that delivers business value, such as application or backend process.
