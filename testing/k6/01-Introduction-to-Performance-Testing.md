# Introduction to Performance Testing

## What is performance testing?

The primary concern of performance testing is how well a system works. Unlike functional testing, which tests whether a system works, performance testing seeks to measure qualitative aspects of a user's experience of a system, such as its responsiveness and reliability.

## Why should we do performance testing?

With performance testing, your team can:

- Improve user experience. Identify potential bottlenecks and issues early in the development process. Performance testing provides a complete picture of what the experience of a user accessing your application is like, beyond just the application functionality.
- Prepare for unexpected demand. Test beyond expected load to find the breaking points of the application and formulate better procedures for responding to add capitalizing on unprecedented success.
- Increase confidence in the application. Lower the overall risk of failure with systematic performance testing. This reduced risk also builds team confidence. Teams can work better knowing their application can withstand unexpected conditions in production.
- Assess and optimize infrastructure. Reduce unnecessary infrastructure costs without compromising performance. Simulate scenarios to observe horizontal and vertical scaling, and run experiments to verify the resources that the system under test actually requires.

## Q&A

**Question 1** Which of the following are not reasons why we should do performance testing?

We want to replace our observability stack with a more proactive testing suite.

**Question 2** Someone tells you performance testing is too expensive. What's a good way to respond?

Performance defects are potentially more expensive to fix after they are deployed to production.

**Question 3** Which of the following statements is true?

Performance testing improves overall team morale by building confidence in what the application can withstand.
