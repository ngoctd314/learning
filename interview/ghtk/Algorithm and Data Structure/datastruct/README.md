**1. Definition of Stack**

Stack is a linear data structure in which insertions and deletions are allowed only at the end, called the top of the stack.

As a stack is a linear data structure, we can implement it using an array or a linked list.

**2. Examples**

**3. Stack as an ADT**

When we define a stack as an ADT, then we are only interested in knowing the stack operations from the user point of view.

Means we are not interested in knowing the implementation details at this moment. We are only interested in knowing what type of operations we can perform on stack.  

**4. Stack Operations**

push(data): Inserts data onto stack.
pop(): Deletes the last inserted element from the stack.
top(): returns the last inserted element without removing it.
size(): returns the size of the number of elements in the stack.
isEmpty(): returns TRUE if the stack is empty, else returns FALSE.
isFull(): returns TRUE if the stack is full, else returns FALSE.
