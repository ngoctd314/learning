# Linking sounds

**Consonant:** b, p, t, d, k, g, s, z, f, v
**Vowel:** a, e, i, o, u

In natural speech words often flow together and then sound like one.

e.g:
+ a lot of
+ some ice

Where linking can happen

- consonant to vowel
- consonant to consonant
- consonant to (near) consonant
- vowel to vowel

- Consonant to vowel

A word ends in a consonant sound and the next word starts with a vowel sound.

e.g. look up

The consonant moves to the vowel sound in second word.

e.g.

wake up
eat out
hold on
come in
turn up
green apple
stop it
he's out
good old
laugh at
