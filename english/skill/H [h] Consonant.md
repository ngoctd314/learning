This sound is simply made hh

By passing air through a very slightly constricted passage.

Either between the tongue and the roof of the mounth or in the throat

This is unvoiced consonant.

Part the lips and press the tongue down in the back just a little.

If you don't constrict the air passage at all.

There is no sound.

If you lift the back of your tongue and constrict too much.

You'll feel the vibration of the soft palate bouncing on the tongue.
