# Present continuous (I am doing)

**am/is/are + -ing** is the present continuous

Sometimes the action in not happening at the time of speaking. For example:

```txt
Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says:
I'm reading a really good book at the moment.
```

Steve say's I'm reading... but he is not reading the book at the time of speaking.  He means that he has started reading the book, but has not finished it yet. He is in the middle of reading it.
