- Rule number one:  No blasphemy.

- I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both.

- As far as they're concerned, there's only three ways to speed tax paying hard than money when it comes to prisons. More walls, more bars and more guards. Still, i'd like to try, with your permission. A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever. Sure can. But your write your letters, if it makes you happy. I'll even mail them for you. How's that? 


**Red**

- Everybody in here's (prison) innocent. Did you know that?

- The risk goes up, the price goes up

- He (Andy Dufresne) had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

- It would take a man about 600 years to tunnel under the wall with one of these (a small rock hammer).

- As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer. You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, i think he did it just to feel normal again.

- And still... he kept sending those letters.

- The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood. 50 years. This is all he knows. In here, he's an important man. He's an educated man. Outside, he's nothing.

- Let me tell you something, my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can dive a man insane. It's got no use on the inside. You'd better get used of that idea.

- You feel you've been rehabilitated? Oh, yes, sir. Without a doubt. And i can honestly say i'm a changed man. No danger to society here. God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.

- Prison time is slow time. Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. Andy build a library.

- That don't make you murderer. A bad husband, maybe.

- And crawled to freedom through 500 yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe i just don't want to. 500 yards. That's the length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile.

- Andy Dufresne who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.

- Do you feel you've been rehabilitated? Rehabilitated? Well, now, let me see.  You know, I don't have any idea what that means. Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society... I know what you think it means, sonny. To me, it's just a made-up word. A politician's word so that... young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie and... have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what i did?  Well, are you? There's not a day goes by i don't feel regret. Not because i'm in here or because you think i should. I look back on the way i was then. A young... Stupid kid who commited that terrible crime. I wanna talk to him. I wanna try and talk some sense to him. But i can't. That kid's long gone. This old man is all that's left. I gotta live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit.

- Get busy living or get busy dying.

**Brooks**

- It's the only way they'd let me stay.

**Andy Dufresne**

- It only took six years. From now on, i'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

- It was in here (head), in here (heart). That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you.

- On the outside, i was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.

- My wife used to stay I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. She was beautiful. God, I loved her. I just didn't know how to show it, that's all. I killed her, Red. I didn't pull the trigger. But i drove her away. That's why she died, because of me. The way I am.

- A warm place with no memory. Open up a little hotel, right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat, fix it up new. Take my guests out. Charter fishing.

- Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison.

- I remember thinking it would take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it (rock hammer). Andy did it in less than 20.

- In prison, a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied. It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard. A handful at a time.

- How often do you really look at a man's shoes?
