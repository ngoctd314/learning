**Red:**

We see by your file you've served 20 years of a life sentence

Yes, sir.

You feel you've been rehabilitated?

Oh, yes, sir. Alsolutely, sir.

I mean, i learned my lesson. I can honestly say... I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's God' honest truth.

- Rule number one:  No blasphemy.

- I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both.

- As far as they're concerned, there's only three ways to speed tax paying hard than money when it comes to prisons. More walls, more bars and more guards. Still, i'd like to try, with your permission. A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever. Sure can. But your write your letters, if it makes you happy. I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

- Everybody in here's (prison) innocent. Did you know that?

- The risk goes up, the price goes up

- He (Andy Dufresne) had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

- It would take a man about 600 years to tunnel under the wall with one of these (a small rock hammer).

- As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer. You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, i think he did it just to feel normal again.

- And still... he kept sending those letters.

- The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood. 50 years. This is all he knows. In here, he's an important man. He's an educated man. Outside, he's nothing.

- Let me tell you something, my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can dive a man insane. It's got no use on the inside. You'd better get used of that idea.

- You feel you've been rehabilitated? Oh, yes, sir. Without a doubt. And i can honestly say i'm a changed man. No danger to society here. God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated.


**Brooks**

- It's the only way they'd let me stay.

**Andy Dufresne**

- It only took six years. From now on, i'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

- It was in here (head), in here (heart). That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you.
