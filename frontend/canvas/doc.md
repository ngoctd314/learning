# Canvas

The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JS and the HTML <canvas> element.

## The grid

1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas.

Unlike SVG, <canvas></canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths.

+ fillRect(x, y, width, height)

Draws a filled rectangle

+ strokeReact(x, y, width, height)

Draws a rectangular outline
