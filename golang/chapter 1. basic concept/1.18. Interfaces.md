# Interfaces in Go

Fundamentally, interface types make Go support value boxing.

Before Go 1.18 all interface types may be used as value types. But since Go 1.18 some interface types may be only used as type constraints. Interface types which may be used as value types are called basic interface types.

## Interface Types and Type Sets

An interface type defines some (type) requirements. All non-interface types satisfying these requirements form a type set, which is called the type set of the interface type.

## Method Sets of Types

Each type has a method set associated with it.

- For a non-interface type, its method set is composed of the specifications of all the methods (either explicit or implicit ones) declared for it.
- For an interface type, its method set is composed of all the method specifications it specifies, either directly or indirectly through embedding other types.

## Basic Interface Types

Basic interface types are the interface types which may be used as value types. A non-basic interface type is also called a constraint-only interface type.
