# Strings in Go

This article will list all the facts of strings

## The Internal Structure of String Types

```go
type _string struct {
    elements *byte // underlying bytes
    len int // number of bytes
}
```
A string is actually a byte sequence wrapper. We can really view a string as an (element-immutable) byte slice.

## More fact about string types and values in Go

- Like Java, the contents (underlying bytes) of string values are immutable. The lengths of string values also can't be modified separately. An addressable string value can only be overwritten as a whole by assigning another string value to it.

- Use the element access syntax aString[i] introduced in container element accesses to get the ith byte value stored in aString. The expression aString[i] is not addressable. Value aString[i] can't be modified.

- For standard Go compiler, the destination string variable and source string value in a string assignment will share the same underlying byte sequence in memory. The result of a substring expression aString[start:end] also shares the same underlying byte sequence with the base string aString in memory.
