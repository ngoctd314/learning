# Basic Types and Basic Value Literals 

Types can be viewed as value templates, and values can be viewed as type instances. 

## Built-in Basic Types in Go

## Zero Values

Each type has a zero value. The zero value of a type can be viewed as the default value of the type.

## Basic Value Literals

A literal of a value is a text representation of the value in code. A value may have many literals. The literals denoting values of basic types are called basic value literals.
