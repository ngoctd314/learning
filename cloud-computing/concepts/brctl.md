# brctl

`brctl` is a command-line utility used to manage Ethernet bridge devices in Linux. It stands for "Bridge Control". Ethernet bridges are software-based network devices that connect multiple network interfaces (physical or virtual) together at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They operate similarly to physical network switches, forwarding packets between connected intefaces based on MAC addresses.
