In Ubuntu, `cpu-checker` is a package that provides utilities for checking various CPU features, capabilities, and virtualization support. It includes tools to detect CPU features such as virtualization extensions (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V), hardware virtualization support, and CPU compatibility with specific virtualization technologies.
