# KVM vs VMware: A Complete Virtualization Comparison

https://www.liquidweb.com/blog/kvm-vs-vmware/

## What is KVM?

KVM is a kernel-based virtual machine or Type 1 Hypervisor built into Linux. A hypervisor is what runs your virtual machines.

In many cases, the hypervisor has to be installed to be used. KVM's tight integration into Linux and the Linux package manager makes it a very popular choice for those using hypervisors. This full integration with Linux also makes it quite simple and quite stable.

Although KVM has full-blown Linux running in the background, which uses additional server resources, KVM running in the kernel does help eliminate some of the overhead.

## What is VMware vSphere?

VMware ESXi runs all of our virtual machines on a single host. For those comparing Linux KVM vs VMWare, ESXi is also a Type 1 Hypervisor.

The ESXi bare metal hypervisor is built in to be very efficient and use little resources, which leaves more resources for your virtual machines. VMware vSphere controls multiple ESXi hosts from a single interface.

When comparing KVM vs vSphere, you'll see that KVM is really more appropriate to compare vs VMware ESXi. KVM doesn't really have an interface like vSphere which is why Liquid Web provides a simple management interface at no cost to customers.

vSphere and ESXi are the top tools in the field of virtualization. If you're looking for enterprise-level virtualization with features such as high availability and zero-downtime migrations, VMware is what you want.

## Use Cases for KVM

**Basic High Availability**

High availability means if your server goes down or becomes unavailable, it will switch to your backup server and still run. 

If you want this for your virtual machine, HA KVM will work nicely. If you want more advanced virtualization features for your HA setup, you might need to upgrade to a more advanced product.

**Server Images**

Server images allow you to restore your server to working condition in the event of accidental file deletion or removal, malicious attack, or hardware failure.
