# Managing State

## Reacting to input with state

In React, you don't directly manipulate the UI - meaning you don't enable, disable, show or hide components directly. Instead, you declare what you want to show, and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn.
