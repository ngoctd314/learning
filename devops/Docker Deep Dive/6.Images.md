# Images

In this chapter we'll dive into Docker images. The aim of the game is to give you a solid understanding of what Docker images are and how to perform basic operations, and how they work under-the-hood.

## Docker images - The TLDR

A container image is read-only package that contains everything you need to run an application. It includes application code, application dependencies, a minimal set of OS constructs, and metadata. A single image can be used to start one or more containers.

If you're a developer you can think of them as similar to classes. You can create one or more object from a class - you can create one or more containers from an image.

Images are made up of multiple layers that are stacked on top of each other and represented as a single object. Inside of the image is a cut-down operating system (OS) and all of the files and dependencies required to run an application. Because containers are intended to be fast and lightweight, images tend to be small.

## Docker images - The deep dive

We've mentioned a couple of times already that images are like stopped containers. In fact, you can stop a container and create a new image from it. With this in mind, images are considered build-time constructs, whereas containers are run-time constructs.

**Images and containers**

We use docker run and docker service create commands to start one or more containers from a single image. Once you've started a container from an image, the two constructs become dependent on each other, and you cannot delete this image until the last container using it has been stopped and destroyed.

**Images are usually small**

The whole purpose of a container is to run a single application of service. This means it only needs the code and dependencies of the app it's running - it doesn't need anything else. This means images are also small and stripped of all non-essential parts.

For example, at the time of writing the official Alpine Linux image is 7MB. This is because it doesn't ship with 6 different shells, three different managers and more...

Images don't include a kernel. This is because containers share the kernel of the host they're running on. It's normal for the only OS components included in an image to be a few important filesystem components and other basic constructs. This is why you'll sometimes hear people say "images contain just enough OS".

## Pulling images

```bash
docker pull <name>:<tag>
```

## Image naming

When pulling image, you have to specify the name of the image you're pulling. Let's take a minute to look at image naming.

**Image registers**

We store images in centralised places called registers. Most modern registries implement the OCI distribution-spec and we sometimes call the OCI registers. The job of a registry is to securely store container images and make them easy to access from different environments. Some registries offer advanced services such as image scanning and integration with build pipelines.

Image registries contain one or more image repositories. In turn, image repositories contain one or more images. That might be a bit confusing.

## Image naming and tagging

Addressing images from official repositories is as simple as providing the repository name and tag separated by a colon (:). The format for docker pull, when working with an image from an official repository is:

```sh
docker pull <repository>:<tag>
```
