# Containers from 30,000 feet

Containers are definitely a thing.

In the container model the container is roughly analogous to the VM. The major difference through, is that every container does not require a full-blown OS. In fact, all containers on a single host share a single OS. This frees up huge amounts of system resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. It also reduces potential licensing costs and reduces the overhead of OS patching and other maintenance. This results in savings on the cap-ex and op-ex fronts.
