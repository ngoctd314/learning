# Operating Systems

## Linux

### Linux Fundamentals

#### What is Linux

Linux is an operating system or a kernel distributed under an os license. Its functionality list is quite like UNIX. The kernel is a program at the heart of the Linux operating system that takes care of fundamental stuff, like letting hardware communicate with software.

Hardware (CPU,Memory, Hard Drive) -> Operating System (windows, linux) -> end user.

**1. Why do you need an OS?**

OS or kernel which connect you and hardware. To work on your computer, you need an OS. In fact, you are using one as you read this on your computer. Now you may have used popular OS's Windows, Apple OS X, but here we will learn introduction to Linux os.

**2. Who created Linux?**

Linus Torvarlds

**3. Linux get its due attention**

The main advantage of Linux was that programmers were able to use the Linux Kernel to design their own custom operating systems.

**4. Benefits of Linux**

- Being open-source, anyone with programming knowledge can modify it.
- It is easy to learn Linux for beginners.
- The Linux os now offer millions of programs/applications and Linux software to choose from.
- Once you have Linux installed you no longer need an antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system.
- Linux freeware is the OS of choice for Server env. A Linux based server could run non-stop without a reboot for years on end.

#### Linux command line Tutorial

- To manage your files, you can use either the GUI (File manager) or the CLI (Terminal) in Linux. Both have its relative advantages.

#### Basic Linux/Unix commands

|Command|Description|
|-|-|
|ls -R|show all the files not only in directories but also sub-directories|
|ls -al|gives detailed information of the files. The command provides information in a columnar format|

## Unix

### What is Unix os

UNIX is an os system family that originated in the late 1960s at AT&T Bell Labs. It has had a significant influence on modern computing and has served as the foundation for various os, including Linux.

## Notes

**1. Compare Linux and Unix**

- Origin and History:

    - Unix: Unix was one of the earliest os and laid the foundation for many modern os concepts.
    - Linux: Linux was inspired by Unix design principle and aimed to provide a freely available and customizable os.

- Licensing:

    - Unix: Unix os were typically proprietary and came with commercial licenses.
    - Linux: Linux is open source and distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or other open-source licenses. It can be freely used, modified and distributed

In summary, while Unix and Linux share similarities and both adhere to Unix design principles, they are distinct in terms of licensing, development, kernel, distribution models, and historial context. Linux is a specific open-source kernel, while Unix refers to a family of os, both propriately and open-source.
