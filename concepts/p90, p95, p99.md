Latency metrics play a critical role in evaluating the performance of your applications and services. By observing P90, P95, and P99 latencies, you can identify potential bottlenecks, optimize user experience, and ensure that your systems achieve high performance for the majority of users.

**1. P90 (90th percentile):** This metric signifies that 90% of requests are completed within the given latency value, while the remaining 10% took longer. Monitoring P90 helps you understand the application's performance for most users, optimizing it for the majority of traffic.

**2. P95 (95th percentile):** P95 latency reveals that 95% of requests fall below the specified threshold. This metric gives you additional insights into user experience, allowing you to cater to a wider audience.

**3. P99 (99th percentile):** The P99 metric indicates that 99% of requests are completed within the recorded latency. This value considers the long tail of request times, enabling you to identify problems that only affect a small percentage of users.
