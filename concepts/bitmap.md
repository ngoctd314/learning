# Bitmap

In computing, a bitmap is a mapping from some domain (for example, a range of integers) to bits. It is also called a bit array or bitmap index.

As a noun, the term "bitmap" is very often used to refer to a particular bitmapping application: the pix-map, which refers to a map of pixels, where each one may store more than two colors, thus using morethan one bit per pixel. In such a case, the domain is question is the array of pixels which constitude a digital graphic output device (a screen or monitor). In some contexts, the term bitmap implies one bit per pixel, whereas pixmap is used for images with multiple bits per pixel.

A bitmap is a type of memory organization or image file format used to store digital images. The term bitmap comes from the computer programming terminology, meaning just a map of bits, a spatially mapped array of lists.
