# AST - Abstract Syntax Tree

AST stands for Abstract Syntax Tree. An Abstract Syntax Tree is a tree representation of the abstract syntatic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node in the tree represents a construct in the source code, such as a variable declaration, function call, or loop.

The purpose of an AST is to provide a structured and hierarchical representation of the code's syntax, making it easier for tools and compilers to analyze and manipulate the code. ASTs are commonly used in programming language processing, static analysis, code generation, and various other tools that need to understand the structure of course code.
