# Overview

## Time complexity

When we write an algorithm, we usually care about cpu processing and memory consume.

To estimate time execution of an algorithm base on input, we use concept: time complexity of algorithm.

Time complexity is a function measures basic operation which algorithm must execute, with n is size of input: y = f(n)

In reality, mostly algorithms will be evaluated by worst case.

## Sorting

When compare sorting algorithm we care about:

+ Time execution
+ Memory consumption
+ Stability

### Bubble sort
