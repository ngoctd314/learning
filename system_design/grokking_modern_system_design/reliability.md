# Reliability

## What is reliability?

Reliability, R is the probability that the service will perform its functions for a specified time. R measures how the service performs under varying operating conditions.

We often use mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) as metrics to measure R.

MTBF = (Total Elapsed Time - Sum of Downtime) / (Total Number of Failures)

MTTR = (Total Maintenance Time) / (Total Number of Repairs)

## Reliability and availability

Reliability measures how well a system performs its intended operations (functional requirements). We use averages for that (Mean Time to Failure, Mean Time to Repair, etc).

Availability measures the percentage of time a system accepts requests and responds to clients.
