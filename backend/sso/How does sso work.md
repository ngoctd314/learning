# How Does Single Sign-On Work

## What is Single Sign-On?

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that enables users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites by using just one set of credentials.

## How Does SSO Work?

SSO works based upon a trust relationship set up between an application, known as the service provider, and an identity provider, like OneLogin.

## What is an SSO Token?

An SSO token is a collection of data or information that is passed from one system to another during the SSO process. The data can simply be a user's email address and information about which system is sending the token. Tokens must be digitally signed for the token receiver to verify that token is coming from a trusted source. The cert that is used for this digital signature is exchanged during the initial configuration process.
