# More control flow

As well as the while statement just introduced, Python uses a few more that we will encounter in this chapter.

```py
x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print("Negative changed to zero")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
elif x == 1:
    print("Single")
else:
    print("More")
```

Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

```py
words = ["cat", "window", "defenestrate"]

for w in words:
    print(w, len(w))
```

Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection.

```py
users = {"Hans": "active", "Hu": "inactive"}

for user, status in users.copy().items():
    if status == "inactive":
        del users[user]

active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
    if status == "active":
        active_users[user] = status

print(users, active_users)
```

## The range() Function

To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:

```py
a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(i, a[i])
```


## Break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops

The break statement breaks out of the innermose enclosing for or while loop

A for or while loop can include an else clause.

In a for loop the else clause is executed after the loop reaches its final iteration.

```py
for n in range(2, 10):
    for x in range(2, n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print(n, "equals", x, "*", n // x)
            break
    else:
        print(n, "is a prime number")
```

The else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.

When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does with that of if statements: a try statement's else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop's else clause run when no break occurs.

The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:

```py
for num in range(2, 10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Found an even number", num)
        continue
    print("Found an odd number", num)
```

## pass Statements

The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.

```py
while True:
    pass

class MyEmptyClass:
    pass

def initlog(*args):
    pass
```

## match statements

```py
def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad Request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        case _:
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"
```

The last block: the variable name _ acts as a wildcard and never fails to match. If no case matches, none of the branches is executed.

You can combine several literals in a single pattern using | ("or"):

```py
case 401 | 403 | 404:
    return "Not allowed"
```

Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind variables:

```py
match point:
    case (0, 0):
        print("Origin")
    case (0, y):
        print(f"Y={y}")
    case (x, 0):
        print(f"X={x}")
    case (x, y):
        print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")
    case _:
        raise ValueError("Not a point")
```
