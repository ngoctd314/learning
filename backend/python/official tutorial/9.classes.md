# Classes

Classes provides a means of bunding data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by it class) for modifying its state.

Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechnism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name.

## A word about names and objects

Objects have individually, and multiple names (in multiple scopes)  can be bound to the same object. This is known as aliasing in the other languages. This is usually not apprecicated on a first glance at Python, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the impl.
