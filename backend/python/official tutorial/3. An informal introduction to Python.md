# 3. An informal introduction to Python

## 3.1. Using Python as a Calculator

**Numbers**

The integer numbers have type int, the ones with a fractional part (5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.

Division / always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the // operator to calculate the remainder you can use %

```py
print(17 / 3)
print(17 // 3)
print(17 % 3)
print((17 // 3) * 3 + 17 % 3)
```

With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to caculate powers:

```py
print(5**2) # 5 squared
print(2**7) # 2 to the power of 7
```

**Text**

Python can manupulate text (represented by type str, so-called strings) as well as numbers.

String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes """

String can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:

```py
3* 'un' + 'um'
```
