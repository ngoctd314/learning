## Creating a model to work with

For the purposes of this tutorial we're going to start by creating a simple Snippet model that is used to store code snippets. Go ahead and edit the snippets/models.py file.

We'll also need to create an initial migration for our snippet model, and sync the database for the first time.

```txt
python manage.py makemigrations snippets
python manage.py migrate snippets
```

## Creating a Serializer class

The first thing we need to get started on our Web API is to provide a way of serializing and deserializing the snippet instances into representations such as json.


```py
def create(self, validated_data):
def update(self, instance, validated_data):
```

We can actually also save ourselves some time by using the ModelSerializer class, as we'll see later, but for now we'll keep our serializer definition explicit.

## Working with Serializers

**Using ModelSerializer**

Our SnippetSerializer class is replicating a lot information that's also contained in the Snippet model. It would be nice if we could keep our code a bit concise.
