# Coding for User Experience

Testing, user experience, and dependency graphs. 

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

- Optimizing for humans
- A security blanket named unit tests
- Test-included damage

## Optimizing for humans

UX typically refers to customers, which make sense - that is, after all, where the money is. However, we programmers are missing out on something rather significant. Let me ask you, who are the users of the code you write? Not the customers that use the software itself. The users of the code are your colleagues and the future version of you. As programmers, we get paid to deliver features rather than beautiful code, and code with good UX enables the faster delivery of features, and with less risk.

## What does user experience mean for Go code

What does UX mean for Go code? The short version is, we should write code whose general intent is understood after a quick first read by any competent programmer.

**1. Start with simple - get complicated only when you must**

We should strive to keep things simple, and resort to complexity when there is no other way.

```go
func NotSoSimple(id int64, name string, age int, registered bool) string {
    out := &bytes.Buffer{}
    out.WriteString(strconv.FormatInt(id, 10))
    out.WriteString("-")
    out.WriteString(strings.Replace(name, " ", "_", -1))
    out.WriteString("-")
    out.WriteString(strconv.Itoa(age))
    out.WriteString("-")
    out.WriteString(strconv.FormatBool(registered))

    return out.String()
}
```

How about this one:

```go
func Simpler(id int64, name string, age int, registered bool) string {
    nameWithNoSpaces := strings.Replace(name, " ", "_", -1)
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d-%s-%d-%t", id, nameWithNoSpaces, age, registered)
}
```

Applying the approach embodied in the first code to an entire system will almost certainly make it run faster, but not only did it likely take longer to code, but it's also harder to read and therefore maintain and extend.

There will be times when you need extract extreme performance from your code, but it's far better to wait until it cannot be avoided before burdening yourself with the extra complexity.

**2. Apply just enough abstraction**

```go
type myGetter interface {
    Get(url string) (*http.Response, error)
}

func TooAbstract(getter myGetter, url string) ([]byte, error) {
    resp, err := getter.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    return ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
}
```

Compare to the previous code

```go
func CommonConcept(url string) ([]byte, error) {
    resp, err := http.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    return ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
}
```

**3. Follow industry, team, and language conventions**

**4. Export only what you must**

It becomes easier for others to understand; when a method has fewer parameters, it is natually easier to understand.

```go
NewPet("Fido", true)
```

What does true mean? It's hard to tell without opening the function or the document. However
However, what if we do the following:

```go
NewDog("Fido")
```

In this case, the purpose is clear, mistakes are unlikely and, as a bonus, encapsulation is improved.

Similarly, interfaces and structs with fewer methods and packages with objects are all easier to understand, and are more likely to have a more definite purpose.

```go
type WideFormatter interface{
    ToCSV(pets []Pet) ([]byte, error)
    ToGOB(pets []Pet) ([]byte, error)
    ToJSON(pets []Pet) ([]byte, error)
}
```

Compare the preceding code to the following:

```go
type ThinFormatter interface {
    Format(pets []Pet) ([]byte, error)
}

type CSVFormatter struct {}

func (f CSVFormatter) Format(pets []Pet) ([]byte, error) {}
```

## Aggressively apply the single responsibility principle

Applying the single responsibility principle (SRP) encourages objects to be more concise and mor coherent and there fore easier to understand.

## Discovering a good user experience

Ask yourself the following four questions:

- Who is the user?
- What are your users capable of?
- Why do users want to use your code?
- How do your users expect to use it.

### Who is the user?

Much of the time, the answer will be future me and my colleagues. Your future me will be a better, smarter, and more handsome version of who you are now. Your colleagues, on the other hand, are harder to predict. What ever we do, they will understand. An intern, on the other hand, will be harder to predict. Chances are that if we can make our code make sense to them, then it will be just fine for everyone else. 

### What are your users capable of?

### Why do users want to use your code?

Typically, 80% of usage comes from 20% of the use cases. Let me put this into perspective with an example.

I reckon that on at least 80% of the occasions that a person uses an ATM, their purpose is to withdraw money. So what can we do with this information? We can optimize the interface to make the most common use cases as convenient as possible. In the case of the ATM, it could be as simple as putting the withdraw function on the first screen at the top so that users don't have to search for it.

### How do they expect to use it?

```go
// PetFetcher searches the data store for gets whose name matches
// the search string.
// Limit is optional (default is 100). Offset is optional (default 0)
// sortBy is optional (default name). sortAsc is optinal
func PetFetcher(search string, limit int, offset int, sortBy string, sortAsc bool) []Pet {
    return []Pet{}
}
```
That probably looks OK, right? The problem is that most of the usage looks like the following:

```go
results := PetFetcher("Fido", 0, 0, "", true)
```

As you can see, most of the time we don't need all of those return values, and many of the inputs are ignored.

If the exist for some infrequently used but compelling use case, when we can address it another way. The first option would be to split the function into multiple parts; this would allow users to adopt only the complexity the need. The second option is to merge the configuration into an object, allowing users to ignore the parts they don't use.

### When to compromise

Having a great user experience is a desirable goal, but is not a necessity. There are always going to be situations where the UX needs to be compromised. The first and perhaps most common situation is team evolution.

## Final thoughts on coding for user experience

Programmer time, your time, is expensive; you should conserve it in preference of CPU time. Try to remember the following:

- Making something more configurable doesn't make it more usable - it makes it more confusing to use.
- Designing for all use cases makes the code inconvenient for everyone.
- User competence and expectations play.

### A security blanket named unit tests


You must write unit tests for your code; they make you have no bugs. They really don't do that at all.

**Unit tests give you freedom and confidence to refactor**. Reduce risk.

**Existing unit tests make adding new features easier**. Reduce risk.

**Unit tests prevent repeated regression**. There is no way around it - regression sucks. It makes you look bad and it causes you extra work, but it's going to happen. The best we can hope for is to not repeated fix the same bug.

**Unit tests document your intent**

**Unit tests can help restore confidence and increase understanding**

## What should I test?

**Dont test code that is too simple break**

```go
type PetSaver struct {}

func (p PetSaver) Save(pet Pet) (int, error) {
    err := p.validate(pet)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }

    result, err := p.save(pet)
    if err != nil{
        return 0, err
    }

    return p.extractID(result)
}

func (p PetSaver) validate(pet Pet) (error) {
    return nil
}

func (p PetSaver) save(pet Pet) (sql.Result, error) {
    return nil, nil
}

func (p PetSaver) extractID(result sql.Result) (int, error) {
    return 0, nil
}
```

The types of tests are also important. Typically, we should test the following:

- **Happy path:** This is when everything goes as expected. These tests also tend to document how to use the code.
- **Input errors:** Incorrect and unexpected inputs can often cause the code to behave in strage ways.
- **Dependency issues:** The other common cause of failure is when a dependency fails to perform as we need it to.

### Table-driven tests

```go
func TestRound_down(t *testing.T) {
    in := float64(1.1)
    expected := 1

    result := Round(in)
    assert.Equal(t, expected, result)
}

func TestRound_up(t *testing.T) {
    in := float64(3.7)
    expected := 4

    result := Round(in)
    assert.Equal(t, expected, result)
}
```

With test table-driven

```go
func TestRound(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct{
        name string
        in float64
        expected int
    }{
        {
            name: "round down",
            in: 1.1,
            expected: 1
        },
        {
            name: "round up",
            in: 3.7,
            expected: 4
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        in := float64(tt.in)

        result := Round(in)
        assert.Equal(t, tt.expected, result)
    }
}
```

### Stubs

```go
type PersonLoader interface{
    Load(ID int) (*Person, error)
}

// Stubed implementation of PersonLoader
type PersonLoaderStub struct {
    Person *Person
    Error error
}

func (p *PersonLoaderStub) Load(ID int) (*Person, error) {
    return p.Person, p.Error
}
```

With the preceding stub implementation, we can now create one stub instance per scenario with a table-driven test, as shown in the following code:

```go
func TestLoadPersonName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct{
        name string
        loaderStub *PersonLoaderStub
        expectedName string
        expectErr bool
    }{
        {
            name: "happy path",
            loaderStub: &PersonLoaderStub{
                Person: &Person{Name: "tester"},
            },
            expectedName: "tester",
            expectErr: false
        },
        {
            name: "input error",
            loaderStub: &PersonLoaderStub{
                Error: errors.New("something failed")
            },
            expectedName: "",
            expectErr: true
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        result, resultErr := LoadPersonName(tt.LoaderStub, fakeID)
    }
}
```

### Mocks

Mocks are very much like stubs, but they have one fundemental difference. Mocks have expectations. When we used stubs, our tests did nothing to validate our usage of the dependency itself. For example, you might want to use a stub for a logging dependency, unless you are writing a test that ensures the code logs in a specific situation. However, you will often need a mock for a database dependency.

```go
func TestLoadPersonName(t *testing.T) {
    // this value does not matter as the stub ignores it
    fakeID := 1

    tests := []struct{
        name string
        configMock func(stub *PersonLoaderMock)
        expectedName stringo
        expectErr bool
    }{
        {
            name: "happy path",
            configMock: func(stub *PersonLoaderMock) {
                stub.On("Load", mock.Any).Return().Once()
            }
        }
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        stub := &PersonLoaderMock{}
        tt.configMock(stub)
    }
}
```
