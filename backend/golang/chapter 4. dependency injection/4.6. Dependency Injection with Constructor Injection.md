# Dependency Injection with Constructor Injection

The most normal or traditional, constructor injection

## Constructor injection

When an object requires a dependency to work, the easiest way to ensure that dependency is always available is to require all users to supply it as a parameter to the object's constructor. 

The real purpose of DI is not testing. The real purpose of DI is decoupling.

```go
type Mailer struct {
}

func (m *Mailer) Send(to string, body string) error {
    // send mail
    return nil
}

func (m *Mailer) Receive(address string) (string, error) {
    // receive mail
    return "", nil
}
```

We can introduce an abstraction by converting this into an interface based on the method signatures:

```go
// Mailer sends and receive emails
type MailerInterface interface {
    Send(string, string) error
    Receive(string) (string, error)
}
```

Hang on, we only need to send emails. Let's apply the interface segregation principle and reduce the interface to only the methods we use and update our constructor.

```go
type Sender interface {
    Send(string, string) error
}

func NewWelcomeSenderV2(in Sender) *WelcomeSenderV2 {
    return &WelcomeSenderV2{
        sender: in
    }
}
```

First, our code is now entirely self-contained. This means any bugs, extensions, tests, or other changes will only involve this package.

Second, we can use mocks or stubs to test our code, stopping us from spamming ourselves with emails and requiring a working email server for our tests to pass

Lastly, we are no longer tied to the Mailer class. If we wanted to change from a welcome email to an SMS or tweet, we could change our input parameter to a different Sender and be done.

By defining our dependency as an abstraction (as a local interface) and passing that dependency into our constructor, we have explicitly defined our requirements and given us greater freedom in our testing and extensions.

## Addressing the duck in the room

Go's support for implicit interfaces and how we can leverage it to perform dependency inversion and decouple objects. To those of you familiar with Python or Ruby, this may have felt like duck typing.

**If it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.**

**At runtime, dynamically determine an object's suitability based only on the parts of that object that are accessed**

Let's look at a Go example to see if it supports duck typing
```go
type Taker interface {
    Speak() string
    Shout() string
}

type Dog struct{}

func (d Dog) Speak() string {
    return "Woof!"
}

func (d Dog) Shout() string {
    return "WOOF!"
}

func SpeakExample() {
    var talker Talker
    talker = Dog{}

    fmt.Print(talker.Speak())
}
```

From our example, it looks like Go might suport duck typing, but there are a couple of problems:

- In duck typing, compatibility is determined at runtime; Go will check our Dog type implements Talker at compile time.
- In duck typing, suitability is only based on the parts of the object accessed. In previous example, only the Speak() method is actually used. However, if our Dog type did not implement the Shout() method, then it would fail to compile.

So if it's not duck typing, what is it? Something somewhat similar called structural typing. structural typing is a static system that determines suitability at compile time based on the type's structure. Go provide the safety of compile-time checking without the enforced formality of explicitly having to state the interfaces implemented.

## Advantages of constructor injection

**Separation from the dependency life cycle** Constructor injection, like most DI methods, spearate the life cycle management of the dependency from the object that it's being injected into. By doing this, the object becomes more straightforward and easier to understand.

**Easy to implement**

```go
type WelcomeSender struct {
    Mailer *Mailer
}

func (w *WelcomeSender) Send(to string) error {
    body := w.buildMessage()

    return w.Mailer.Send(to, body)
}
```

**Predictable and consise**

By moving the assignment of the dependency to the constructor, we are not only being explicit about our requirements, but we are also ensuring that the dependency is set and available to our methods. This is particularly true if we include a guard clause in the constructor. Without the constructor, each method might have to include a guard clause or risk throwing a nil pointer exception:

```go
type Car struct {
    Engine Engine
}

func (c *Car) Drive() error {
    if c.Engine == nil {
        return errors.New("engine is missing")
    }

    // use the engine
    c.Engine.Start()
    c.Engine.IncreasePower()

    return nil
}
```

Instead of, which is more concise:

```go
func NewCar(engine Engine) (*Car, error) {
    if engine == nil {
        return nil, errors.New("invalid engine supplied")
    }

    return &Car{
        engine: engine,
    }, nil
}

type Car struct {
    engine Engine
}

func (c *Car) Drive() error {
    // use the engine
}
```

**Encapsulation**

**Helps to uncover code smells**

It's an easy trap to add just one more feature to an existing struct or interface. As we saw during our earlier discussions of the single responsibility principle, we shoule resist urge and keep our objects and interfaces as small as possible. One easy way to spot when an objects has too many responsibilities is to count its dependencies. Typically, the more responsibilities an object has, the more dependencies is will accumulate. Therefore with all the dependencies clearly listed in one place, the constructor, it's easy to get a whiff that something might not be quite right.

## Applying constructor injection

This time we will be refactoring the REST package, starting with the Register endpoint (another endpoints: Get and List)

The Register endpoint has three responsibilities:

- Validate the registration is complete and valid
- Call the currency conversion service to convert the registration price to the currency requested in the registration
- Save the registration and the converted registration price into the database

## Decoupling from the dependency

## Improving test scenario coverage

The first thing we will do is break the dependence on the upstream service in the test. Then, we will proceed to add tests to cover additional scenarios that we couldn't cover before. 

```go
func TestRegisterHandler_ServeHTTP(t *testing.T) {
    scenarios := []struct{
        desc                string
        inRequest           func() *http.Request
        inModelMock         func() *MockRegisterModel
        expectedStatus      int
        expectedHeader      string
    }
}
```

## Disadvantages of constructor injection

When it comes to DI, sadly there is no sliver bullet. Despite the utility of constructor injection, it cannot be used in all cases. This section covers the disadvantages and limitations of constructor injection.

**Can cause lots of changes**

When applying constructor injection to existing code, it can result in a lot of changes.

**Can cause initialization issues**

**The dangers of overuse**

**Non-obvious requirement**

**Constructors are not inherited**
