# Structs in Go

## Struct types and struct type literals

The size of a struct type is the sum of the sizes of all its field types plus the number of some padding bytes. The padding bytes are used to align the memory addresses of some fields.

## Composite literal are unaddressable but can take addresses

Generally, only addressable values can take addresses. But there is a syntactic sugar in Go, which allows us to take addresses on composite literals. A syntatic sugar is an exception in syntax to make programming convenient.

```go
type Book struct {
    Pages int
}
// Book{100} is unaddressable but can be taken addressd
p := &Book{100} // <=> tmp := Book{100}; p = &tmp
```
