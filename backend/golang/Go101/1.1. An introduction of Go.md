# An Introduction of Go

Go is a compiled and static typed programming language. Go has many features. Some are unique, some are borrowed from other programming languages:

- built-in concurrent programming support
    - goroutines (green threads) and start new goroutines easily
    - channels (based on CSP model) and select mechanisms to do synchronizations between goroutines
- pointers
- function closures
- memory safety
- automatic garbage collection
- great cross-platform compatibility

Readability is an important factor which affects the design of Go heavily. It is not hard for a gopher to understand the Go code written by other gophers.

Programs written in go language mostly compile very fast. Compilation time is an important factor for the happiness in development. Short build time is one reason why many programmers like programming with Go.
