# Go: Simple to learn but hard to master

A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

## Go outline

Why does Go not have feature X? Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.

Go utilizes a few essential characteristics when adopting a language at scale for an organization.

- Stability: Even though Go receives frequent updates (including improvements and security patches),it remains a stable language.

- Expressivity

- Compilation: fast compilation times

- Safety: Go is strong, statically typed language.

Go was built from the ground up with solid features such as outstanding concurrency primitives with goroutines and channels.
