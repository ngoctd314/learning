# Strings

In Go, a string is an immutable data structure holding the following:

- A pointer to an immutable byte sequence
- The total number of bytes in this sequence

We will see in this chapter that Go has a pretty unique way to deal with strings. Go introduces a concept called runes; this concept is essential to understand and may confuse newcomers. Once we know how strings are managed, we can avoid common mistakes while iterating on a string.

## 36. Not understanding the concept of a rune

We couldn't start this chapter about strings without discussing the concept of the rune in Go. As you will see in the following sections, this concept is key to thoroughly understanding how strings are handled and avoiding common mistakes. But before delving into Go runes, we need to make sure we are aligned about some fundamental programming concepts.

We should understand the distinction between a charset and and encoding:

- A charset, as the name suggests, is a set of characters. For example, the Unicode charset contains 2^21 characters.
- An encoding is the translation of a character's list in binary. For example, UTF-8 is an encoding standard capable of encoding all the Unicode characters in a variable number of bytes (from 1 to 4 bytes).

We mentioned characters to simplify the charset definition. But in Unicode, we use the concept of a code point to refer to an item represented by a single value.

In Go, a rune is a Unicode code point. Meanwhile, we mentioned that UTF-8 encodes characters into 1 to 4 bytes, hence up to 32 bits. This is why in Go, a rune is an alias of int32.

```go
type rune = int32
```

Another thing to hightlight about UTF-8: some people believe that Go strings are always UTF-8, but this isn't true. Let's consider the following example:

```go
s := "hello"
```

We assign a string literal (a string constant) to s. In Go, a source code is encoded in UTF-8, all string literals are encoded into sequence of bytes using UTF-8. However, a string is a sequence of arbitrary bytes; it's not necessarily based on UTF-8. Hence, when we manipulate a variable that wasn't initialized from a string literal (for example, reading from the filesystem), we can't necessarily assume that it uses the UTF-8 encoding. 

Let's get back to the hello example. We have a string conposed of five characters: h, e, l, l and o.

These simple characters are encoded using a single byte each. This is why getting the length of s return 5:

```go
s := "hello"
fmt.Println(len(s)) // 5
```

But a character isn't always encoded into a single byte. Coming back to the 汉characer, we mentioned that with UTF-8, this character is encoded into three bytes. We can validate this with the following example:

```go
s := "汉"
fmt.Println(len(s)) // 3
```

Instead of printing 1, this example prints 3.
