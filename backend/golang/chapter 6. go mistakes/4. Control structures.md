## 30. Ignoring the fact that elements are copied in range loops

### Value copy

Understanding how the value is handled during each iteration is critical for using a range loop effectively.

```go
type account struct {
	balance float32
}

func main() {
	accounts := []account{{100}, {200}, {300}}
	for _, ac := range accounts {
		ac.balance += 100
	}
	fmt.Println(accounts)
}
// 100, 200, 300
```

In Go, everything we assign is a copy:

- If we assign the result of a function returning a struct, it performs a copy of that struct.
- If we assign the result of a function returning a pointer, it performs a copy of the memory address (an address is 64 bits long on a 64-bit architecture).

When a range loop iterates over a data structure, it performs a copy of each element to the value variable (the second item)

Coming back to our example, iterating over each account element results in a struct copy being assigned to the value variable a. Therefore, incrementing the balance with ac.balance += 1000 mutates only the value variable (ac), not an element in the slice.

So, what if we want to update the slice elements? There are two main options. The first option is access the element using the slice index. This can be achieved with either a classic for loop or a range loop using the index instead of the value variable:

```go
for i := range accounts {
    accounts[i].balance += 1000
}
for i := 0; i < len(accounts); i++ {
    accounts[i].balance += 1000
}
```

Both iterations have the same effect: updating the elements in the accounts slice.

**Updating slice elements: A third option**

Another option is to keep the range loop and access the value but modify the slice type to a slice of account pointers:

```go
accounts := []*account{{100}, {200}, {300}}

for _, a := range accounts {
    a.balance += 1
}
```

In this case, as we mentioned, the a variable is a copy of the account pointer stored in the slice. But as both pointers reference the same struct, the a.balance += 1 statement updates the slice element.

However, this option has two main downsides. First, it requires updating the slice type, which may not always be possible. Second, it performance is important, we should note that iterating over a slice of pointers may be less efficient for a CPU because of the lack of predictability.

In general, we should remember that the value element in a range loop is a copy. Therefore, if the value is a struct we need to mutate, we will only update the copy, not the element itself, unless the value of field we modify is a pointer. The favored options are to access the element via the index using a range loop or a classic for loop.
