## 42. Not knowning which type of receiver to use

Choosing a receiver type for a method isn't always straightforward. When should we use value receiver? When should we use pointer receivers? In this section, we look at the conditions to make the right decision.

In many contexts, using a value or pointer receiver should be dictated not by performance, but rather by other conditions that we will discuss.

In Go, we can attach either a value or a pointer receiver to a method. With a value receiver, Go makes a copy of the value and passed it to the method. Any changes to the object remain local to the method. The original object remains unchanged.

On the other hand, with a pointer receiver, Go passes the address of an object to the method. It remains a copy, but we copy a pointer, not the object itselft (passing by reference doesn't exist in Go). Any modifications to the receiver are done on the original object. Here is the same example, but now the receiver is a pointer:

```go
type customer struct {
    balance float64
}

func (c *customer) add(operation float64) {
    c.balance += operation
}

func main() {
    c := customer{balance: 100.0}
    c.add(50.0)
    fmt.Printf("balance: %.2f\n", c.balance)
}
```

Choosing between value and pointer receivers isn't always straightforward.

**A receiver must be a pointer**

- If the method needs to be mutate the receiver. This rule is also valid if the receiver is a slice and a method needs to append elements:

```go
type slice []int

func (s *slice) add(element int) {
    *s = append(*s, element)
}
```

- If the method receiver contains a field that cannot be copied: for example, a type part of the sync package

**A receiver should be a pointer**

- If the receiver is a large object. Using a pointer can make the call more efficient, as doing so prevents making an extensive copy. When in doubt about how large is large, benchmark can be the solution; it's pretty much impossible to state a specific size, because it depends on many factors.

**A receiver must be a value**

- If we have to enforce a receiver's immutability.
- If the receiver is a map, function, or channel. Otherwise, a compilation error occurs.

**A receiver should be a value**

- If the receiver is a slice that doesn't have to be mutated.
- If the receiver is a small array or struct that is naturally a value type without mutable fields, such as time.Time. 
- If the receiver is a basic type such as int, float64, or string.

```go
type customer struct {
	data *data
}

type data struct {
	balance float64
}

func (c customer) add(operation float64) {
	c.data.balance += operation
}

func main() {
	c := customer{
		data: &data{
			balance: 0,
		},
	}
	c.add(50)
	fmt.Println(c.data.balance)
}
```

balance isn't part of the customer struct directly but is in a struct referenced by a pointer field.

In this case, we dont need to receiver to be a pointer to mutate balance. However, for clarity, we may favor using a pointer receiver to highlight that customer as a whole object is mutable.

**Mixing receiver types**

Are we allowed to mix receiver types, such as a struct containing multiple methods, some of which have pointer receivers and others of which have value receivers? The consensus tends toward forbidding it. However, there are some counterexamples in the standard library, for example, time.Time. The designers wanted to enforce that a time.Time struct is immutable. Hence, most methods such as After, IsZero and UTC have a value receiver. But to a comply with existing interfaces such as encoding.TextUnmarshaler, time.Time has to implement the UnmarshalBinary([]byte) , which mutates the receiver given a byte slice. Thus this method has a pointer receiver.

Consequently, mixing receiver types should be avoided in general but is not forbidden in 100% of cases.

By default, we can choose to go with a value receiver unless there's a good reason not to do so. In doubt, we should use a pointer receiver. 

## 43. Never using named result parameters

Named result parameters are an infrequently used option in Go. This section looks at when it's considered appropriate to use named result parameters to make our API more convenient. But first, let's refresh our memory about how they work.

When a result parameter is named, it's initialized to its zero value when the function/method begins. With named result parameters, we can also call a naked return statement (without arguments).

```go
func f(a int) (b int) {
    b = a
    return
}
```

In this example, we attach a name to the result parameter: b. When we call return without arguments, it returns the current value of b.

When is it recommended that we use named result parameters? First, let's consider the following interface, which contains a method to get the coordinates from a given address:

```go
type locator interface {
    getCoordinates(address string) (float32, float32, error)
}
```
Because this interface is unexported, documentation isn't mandatory. Just by reading this code, can you guess what these two float32 results are? Perhaps they are a lat and a lng, but in which order? Depending on the conventions, lat isn't always the first element. Therefore, we have to check the implementation to understand the results.

In that case, we should probably use named result parameters to make the code easier to read:

```go 
type locator interface {
    getCoordinates(address string) (lat, lng float32, err error)
}
```

**NOTE** If we need to return multiple results of the same type, we can also think about creating an ad hoc struct with meaningful field names. However, this isn't always possible: for example, when satisfying an existing interface that we can't update.

When to use named result parameters depends on the context. In most cases, if it's not clear whether using them makes our code more readable, we shouldn't use named result parameters.

Also note that having the result parameters already initialized can be quite handy in some contexts, even though they don't necessarily help readability. The following example proposed in Effective Go is inspired by io.ReadFull function:

```go
func ReadFull(r io.Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error) {
    return
}
```

In this example, having named result parameters doesnt really increase readability. However, because both n and err are initialized to their zero value, the implementation is shorter.

Another case is in defer.

If we're not careful enough, using named result parameters can lead to side effects and unintended consequences, as we see in the next section.
