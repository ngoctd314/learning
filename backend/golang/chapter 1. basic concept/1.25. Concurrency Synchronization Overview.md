# Concurrent Synchronization Overview

## What are concurrency synchronizations

Concurrency synchronizations means how to control concurrent computations

- To avoid data races between them
- To avoid them consuming CPU resources when they have nothing to do

## Synchronization Techniques Does Go Support?

Besides using channels, Go also supports several other common synchronization techniques, such as mutex and atomic operations.

The data synchronization techniques in Go will not prevent programmers from writting improper concurrent code. However these techniques can help programmers write correct concurrent code easily. And the unique channel related features make concurrent programming flexible and enjoyable.
