# Pointers in Go

## Memory Addresses

A memory address means a specific memory location in programming

A memory address is stored as an unsigned native (integer) word. The size of a native word is 4 bytes on 32-bit architectures and 8 bytes on 64-bit architectures. Memory addresses are often represented with hex integer literals.

## Value address

The address of a value means the start address of the memory segment occupied by the direct part of the value.

## What are pointers?

Pointer is one kind of type in Go. A pointer value is used to store a memory address, which is generally the address of another value.

## About the World "Reference"

In Go 101, the world "reference" indicates a relation. For example, if a pointer value stores the address of another value, then we can say the pointer value (directly) references the other value, and the other value has at least one reference. The uses of the word "reference" in Go 101 are consistent with Go specification.

## How to get a pointer and what are addressable values?

An addressable value means a value which is hosted at somewhere in memory. Currently, we just need to know that all variables are addressable, whereas constants, functions calls and explicit convertion results are all unaddressable. When a variable is declared, Go runtime will allocate a piece of memory for the variable. The starting address of that piece of memory is the address of the variable.
