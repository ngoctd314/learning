# Basic Control Flows

There are three kinds of basic control flow code blocks in Go:

- if-else two-way conditional execution block.
- for loop block.
- switch-case multi-way conditional execution block.
- for-range loop block for container types.
- type-switch multi-way conditional execution block for interface types.
- select-case block for channel types.

## Switch-case Control Flow Blocks

switch-case control flow block is one kind of conditional execution control flow blocks.

```go
switch InitSimpleStatement; CompareOperand {
    case CompareOperandList1:
        // do something
    case CompareOperandList2:
        // do something
    default:
        // do something
}
```

```go
switch n := rand.Intn(100) % 5; n {
    case 0,1,2,3,4:
        fmt.Println("n=", n)
        // The fallthrough statement makes the execution slip into the next brand
        fallthrough
    case 5,6,7,8:
}
```

**Note,**

- a fallthrough statement must be the final statement in a branch 
- a fallthrough statement can't show up in the final branch in a switch-case control flow block

The following fallthrough uses are all illegal

```go
switch n := rand.Intn(100) % 5; n {
    case 0,1,2,3,4:
        fmt.Println("n=", n)
        if true {
            fallthrough // error: not the final statement
        }
    case 5, 6, 7, 8:
        n := 99
        fallthrough // not in the final statement
        _ = n
    default:
        fallthrough // error: show up in the final branch
}
```
