# Strategy pattern

## Intent

+ Define a family of algorithms,
+ Encapsulate each one .
+ Make them interchangeable.
+ Strategy lets algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Motivation

Many algorithms exist for breaking a stream of text into lines. Hard-wiring algorithms into the classes that require them isnt' desirable for several reasons:

- Clients that need linebreaking get more complex if they include the line-breaking code. That makes clients bigger and harder to maintain, especially if they support multiple linebreaking algorithms.
- Different algorithms will be appropriate at different times. We don't want to support multiple linebreaking algorithms if we don't use them all.
- It's difficult to add new algorithms and vary existing ones when linebreaking is an integral part of a client.

We can avoid these problems by defining classes that encapsulate different line-breaking algorithms. An algorithm that's encapsulated in this way is called a strategy.

![]("")

Suppose a Composition class is responsible for maintaining and updating the linebreaks of text displayed in a text viewer. Linebreaking strategies aren't implemented by the class Composition. Instead, they are implemented separately by subclasses of the abstract Compositor class. Compositor subclasses implement different strategies.

A Composition maintains a reference to a Compositor object. Whenever a Composition reformats its text, if forwards this responsibility to its Compositor object. The client of Composition specifies which Compositor should be use by installing the Compositor it desires into the Composition.

## Applicability

Use the Strategy pattern when

- Many related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategies provide a way to configure a class with one of many behavior
- You need differnet variants of an algorithm. 
- An algorithm uses data that clients shouldn't know about. Use the Strategy pattern to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.
- A class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations. Instead of many conditionals, move realted conditional branches into their own Strategy class.

## Participants

- Strategy (Compositor)

Declares an interface common to all supported algorithms. Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy.

- ConcreteStrategy (SimpleCompositor, TexCompositor, ArrayCompositor)

Implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface

- Context (Composition)

Is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object.

Maintains a reference to a Strategy object.

May define an interface that lets Strategy access its data.

## Examples

```go
// problem
// if business use another notifier type 
// we must modification old code
// impact:
// modify code => violate open / close principle
// modify test case 
// maybe create two many ifelse logic
// violate single responsibility
type notifierType string

const (
	emailNotifier notifierType = "email"
	smsNotifier   notifierType = "sms"
)

type notificationService struct {
	notifierType notifierType
}

func (s notificationService) sendNotification(message string) {
	switch s.notifierType {
	case emailNotifier:
		// Do send email logic
		fmt.Printf("Sending message: %s (Sender: %s)\n", message, s.notifierType)
	case smsNotifier:
		// Do send sms logic
		fmt.Printf("Sending message: %s (Sender: %s)\n", message, s.notifierType)
	}
}

func main() {
	s := notificationService{emailNotifier}
	s.sendNotification("Hello World")
}
```

```go
type Notifier interface {
	Send(msg string)
}
type notificationService struct {
	notifier Notifier
}

type EmailNotifier struct {
	notifierType string
}

func (n EmailNotifier) Send(msg string) {
	// Do send email logic
	fmt.Printf("Sending message: %s (Sender: %s)\n", msg, n.notifierType)
}

type SmsNotifier struct {
	notifierType string
}

func (n SmsNotifier) Send(msg string) {
	// Do send sms logic
	fmt.Printf("Sending message: %s (Sender: %s)\n", msg, n.notifierType)
}

func main() {
	smsNotifier := SmsNotifier{"sms"}
	emailNotifier := EmailNotifier{"email"}
	s := notificationService{smsNotifier}
	s.notifier.Send("Hello World")

	s = notificationService{emailNotifier}
	s.notifier.Send("Hello World")
}
```
