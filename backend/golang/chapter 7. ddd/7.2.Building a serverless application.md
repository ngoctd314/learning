# Building a serverless application with Google Cloud Run and Firebase

## Why serverless?

Running a K8s cluster requires a lot of support from "Devops teams".

Small applications that can be easily run on one virtual machine are now being deployed on super complex K8s clusters.

## Google Cloud Run

You just need to provide a Docker container, and Google Cloud runs it.

Serverless solves only infrastructure challenges. It doesn't stop you from building an application that is hard to maintain.
