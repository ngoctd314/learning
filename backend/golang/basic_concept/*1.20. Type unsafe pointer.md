# Type-Unsafe Pointers

The restrictions on type-safe pointers really make us able to write safe Go code with ease, they also make some obstacles to write efficient code for some scenarios.

## About the unsafe Standard Package

Go unsafe pointers mean the types whose underlying types are unsafe.Pointer

The zero values of unsafe pointers are also represented with the predeclared identifier nil.

```go
// get the address alignment of a value. The aligns for struct-field values and non-field values
// of the same type may be different, though for the standard Go compiler, they are always
// the same. For the gccgo compiler, they may be different
func Alignof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr

// 
func Offsetof(selector ArbitraryType) uintptr
```
