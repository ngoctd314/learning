# More about deferred function calls

## Calls to many built-in functions with return results can't be deferred

In Go, the result values of a call to functions can be all absent (discarded). However, for built-in functions with non-blank return result lists, the result values of their call mustn't be absent, except the calls to the built-in copy and recover functions. Result values of a deferred function call must be discarded, so the calls to many built-in functions can't be deferred.
