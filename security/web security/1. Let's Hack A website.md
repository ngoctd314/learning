# Let's hack a website

This book will teach you the essential security knowledge you need to be an effective web developer. Before getting started on that, it's a useful exercise to see how you would go about attacking a website. 

## Software Exploits and the Dark Web

Hackers take advantage of security holes in software such as websites. In the hacking community, a piece of code that illustrates how to take advantage of a security flaw is called an exploit. Some hackers - the good guys, commonly called white hat hackers - try to dicover security holds for fun, and will advise software vendors and website owners of the exploits before making them public. Such hackers often collect a financial reward for doing so.
