# Compromising Authentication

Getting access to a user's account is a tantalizing prospect  for hackers. In the age of the internet, it has never been easier for hackers to sell hacked credentials on the dark web, hijack social media accounts to spread clickbait, and commit financial fraud.

## Implementing Authentication

Authentication is part of the HyperText Transfer Protocol. To present an authentication challenge, a web server needs to return a 401 status code in the HTTP response and add a WWW-Authenticate header describing the preferred authentication method. (There are two commonly supported authentication methods: basic authentication and digest authentication.) To fulfill this requirement, the user agent - usually a web browser - needs to request a username and password from he user, thus creating the login functionality.

In the basic authentication scheme, the browser concatenates username and password supplied by the user with a colon (:) character between them, generating the string username:password. It then uses the Base64 algorithm to encode this string and send it back to the server in the Authorization header of an HTTP request.

The digest authentication scheme is a little more complex, and requires the browser to generate a hash consisting of the username, password and URL.

### HTTP-Native Authentication

Even though authentication is built into the HyperText Transfer Protocol, popular websites rarely use basic or digest authentication - mostly because of usability considerations. The native web browser authentication prompt is not a thing of beauty. It looks similar to a JS alert dialog, grabbing focus from the browser, and interrupting the experience of using the site.

Because browsers implement the authentication prompt outside HTML, we can't style the native authentication prompt to match the website. As a native browser window that doesn't appear in the web page, the browser also can't autocomplete the user's credentials. Finally, because HTTP authentication specifies no method of resetting a password if a user forgets it, we'd have to implement a reset feature separately from the login prompt, leading to a confusing user experience.

### Non-Native Authentication

Modern  websites usually implement their own login forms in HTML

### Brute-Force Attacks

Attackers often attempt to compromise your site at the point of authentication by guessing passwords. Hackers usually have move success using brute-force attacks, which use scripts to try thousands of commonly used passwords against a login page.

## Mitigration

### Mitigration 1: Use Third-Party Authentication

The most secure authentication system is the one you don't have to write yourself. Instead of implementing your own authentication system, consider using a third-party service like Facebook login, which allows users to authenticate to your website with their social media credentials.

### Mitigration 2: Integrate with Single Sign-On

### Mitigration 3: Secure Your Own Authentication System

Although 3rd authentication will usually be more secure than your own system, having only thrid-party authentication could somewhat limit your userbase because not everyone has a social media presence or Gmail. For everyone else, you'll need to create a way for them to sign up and manually choose a username and password.

That's a lot functionality to implement!

## Summary

Hackers often attempt to attack your authentication system in an effort to steal your user's credentials. To secure your website, you can use a 3rd party authentication system like Facebook Login or a sso identity provider.

If you're implementing your own authentication system, you'll need to have users choose a username and password upon sign-up. You should also store and validate an email address for each user. It makes sense to use this email as a username, unless you need users to have a visible display name.
