# Cross-site scripting attacks

In the previous chapter, you saw how attackers can inject code into web servers to compromise websites. If your web server is secure, a hacker's next best injection target is the web browser. If an attacker can find a way to inject malicious JavaScript into a user's browser while the user views your website, that user is in for a bad time. We call this type of code injection a cross-site scripting (XSS) attach.

JavaScript can read or modify any part of a web page, so there's a lot on attacker can do with cross-site script vulnerabilities. They can steal login credentials or other sensitive information like credit card numbers as the user types them in. Cross-site scripting is a remarkably common type of attack, and the dangers is poses are clear.
