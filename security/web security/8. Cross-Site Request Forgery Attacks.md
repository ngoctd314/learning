# Cross-site request forgery attacks

You'll look at how attackers use malicious links to hack your users.

An attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link that triggers undesirable or unexpected side effects. This is called CSRF or XSRF. Security researchers sometimes pronounce CSRF as "sea-surf".

Attackers have used CSRF to steal Gmail contacts lists, trigger one-click purchases on Amazon, and change router configuration.

## Anatomy of a CSRF Attack

Attackers usually launch CSRF attacks by exploiting websites that implement GET requests that change the state of a web server. A GET request is triggered when a victim clicks a link, allowing the attacker to craft misleading links into the target that perform unexpected actions. GET requests are the only type of HTTP request that contain the entirety of the request's content in a URL, so they're uniquely vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

## Mitigration 1: Follow REST Principles

## Mitigration 2: Implement Anti-CSRF Cookies

## Mitigration 3: Use the SameSite Cookie Attribute

## Bonus Mitigration: Require Reauthentication for Sensitive Actions
