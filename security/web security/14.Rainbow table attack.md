# Rainbow Table Attack

## What is a Rainbow Table Attack?

A rainbow table attack is a password cracking method that uses a special table (a "rainbow table") to crack the password hashes in a database. Application don't store passwords in plaintext, but instead encrypt passwords using hashes. After the user enters their password to login, it is converted to hashes, and the result is compared with the stored hashes on the server to look for a match.

The rainbow table itself refers to a precomputed table that contains the password hash value for each plain text character used during the authentication process. If hackers gain access the list of password hashes, they can crack all passwords very quickly with a rainbow table.
