# File upload vulnerabilities

Browsers make it easy to upload files via built-in file-upload widgets and JS APIs that allow you to drag files onto a web page and send them asynchronous to the server.

However, browsers aren't exactly careful about checking the contents of a file. Attackers can easily abuse file upload functions by injectecting mailicious code into an uploaded file.
