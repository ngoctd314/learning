# System Design Interviews

## What Is a System Design Interview?

## Present the high-level design

At a high level, components could be frontend, load balancers, caches, data processing, and so on. The system design tells us how these components fit together.

## Possible questions for every SDI

## Theory and practice

Most of the theory of system design comes from the domain of distributed systems. Getting a refresher on these concepts is highly recommended.

Distributed systems give us guideposts for mature software principles.

- Robustness (the ability to maintain operations during a crisis)
- Scalability
- Availability
- Performance
- Extensibility
- Resiliency (the ability to return to normal operations over an acceptable period of time post disruption)

Such terminology also acts as a lingua franca between the interviewer and candidate.

As an example, we might say that we need to make a trade-off between availability and consistency when network components fail because the CAP theorem indicates that we can't have both under network partitions.
