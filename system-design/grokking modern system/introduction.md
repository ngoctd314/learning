# Introduction

## What is system design?

System Design is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data models to build large-scale systems that meet a specified set of functional and non-functional requirements.

System design aims to build systems that are reliable, effective, and maintainable, among other characteristics.

- Reliable systems handle faults, failures, and errors.
- Effective systems meet all user needs and business requirements.
- Maintainable systems are flexible and easy to scale up or down. The ability to add new features also comes under the umbrella of maintainability.

## Strengths of the course

|Strengths|Advantage|
|-|-|
|Building blocks|This is a modern approach to system design where we construct bigger artifacts using smaller building blocks.|
|Building blocks are design problems|We'll treat each one of our building blocks as a stand-alone, mini design problem.|
|Incremental improvement to design|Layer-by-layer design solution addresses added bottlenecks, designing simple and incremental solutions to complex systems.|
