# Optimizing SELECT statements

## WHERE Clause Optimization 

Some of the optimizations performed by MySQL follow:

- Remove of unnecessary parentheses:
((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
-> (a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)

- Constant folding:
(a < b AND b=c) AND a=5
-> b > 5 AND b=c AND a=5

- Constant condition removal
(b>=5 AND b=5) OR (b=6 AND 5=5) OR (b=7 AND 5=6)
-> b=5 OR b=6

- Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once
- Beginning with MySQL 8.0.16 comparisons of columns of numeric types with constant value are checked and folded or removed for invalid or out-of-range values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t WHERE c <= 256
-> SELECT * FROM t WHERE 1;
```
- COUNT(*) on a single table without a WHERE is retrieved directly from the table information for MyISAM and MEMORY tables.
- Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly detects that some SELECT statements are impossible and returns no rows.
- HAVING is merged with WHERE if you do not use GROUP BY or aggregate functions (COUNT(), MIN()), and so on.
