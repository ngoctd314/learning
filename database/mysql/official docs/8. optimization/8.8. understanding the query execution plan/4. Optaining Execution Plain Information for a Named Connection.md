# Obtaining Execution Plan Information for a Named Connection

To obtain the execution plan for an explainable statement executing in a named connection, use this statement:

```sql
EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION connection_id
```

EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION returns the EXPLAIN information that is currently being used to execute a query in a given connection. Because of changes to data (and supporting statistic) it may produce a different result from running EXPLAIN on the equivalent query text. This difference in behavior can be useful in diagnosing more transient performance problems. For example, if you are running a statement in one session that is taking a long time to complete, using EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION in another session may yield useful information about the cause of the delay.

connection_id is the connection identifier. You can specify the identifier only for your own connections.
