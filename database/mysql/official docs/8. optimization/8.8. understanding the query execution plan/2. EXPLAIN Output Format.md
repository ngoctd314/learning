# EXPLAIN Output Format

EXPLAIN returns a row of information for each table used in the SELECT statement. It lists the tables in the output in the order that MySQL would read them while processing the statement. This means that MySQL reads a row from the first table, then finds a matching row in the second table, and then in the third table, and so on. When all tables are processed, MySQL outputs the selected columns and backtracks through the table list until a table is found for which 
there are more matching rows. The next row is read from this table and the process continues with the next table.

## EXPLAIN Output Columns

This section describes the output columns produced by EXPLAIN. Later sections provide additional information about the type and Extra columns.

- id (JSON name:select_id)
The SELECT identifier. This is the sequential number of the SELECT within the query. The value can be NULL if the row refers to the union result of other rows. In this case, the table column shows a value like <unionM, N> to indicate that the row refers to the union of the rows.

- select_type (JSON name:none)

- table (JSON name: table_name)
The name of the table to which the row of output refers. This can also be one of the following values:

<unionM,N>: The row refers to the union of the rows with id values of M and N.

<derivedN>: The row refers to the derived table result for the row with an id value of N. A derived table may result, for example, from a subquery in the FROM clause.

- partitions (JSON name:partitions)

The partitions from which records would be matched by the query. The value is NULL for nonpartitioned tables.

- type (JSON name:access_type)

The join type.

- possible_keys (JSON name: possible_keys)
The possible_keys column indicates the indexes from which MySQL can choose to find the rows in this table. Note that this column is totally independent of the order of the tables as displayed in the output from EXPLAIN. That means that some of the keys possible_keys might not be usable in practice with the generated table order.

If this column is NULL (or undefined in JSON-formatted output), there are no relevant indexes. In this case, you may be able to improve the performance of your query by examining the WHERE clause to check whether it refers to some EXPLAIN again.

- key (JSON name: key)

The key column indicates the key(index) that MySQL actually decided to use. If MySQL decides to use one of the possible_keys indexes to look up rows, that index is listed as the key value.

It is possible that key name an index that is not present in the possible_keys value. This can happen if none of the possible_keys indexes are suitable for looking up rows, but all columns selected by the query are columns of some other index. That is, the named index covers the selected columns, so althoughh it is not used to determine which rows to retrieve, an index scan is more efficient that a data row scan.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO t1 (id) VALUES (1), (2), (3);
EXPLAIN SELECT id FROM t1;
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+--------+------+----------+-------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type  | possible_keys | key     | key_len | ref    | rows | filtered | Extra       |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+--------+------+----------+-------------+
| 1  | SIMPLE      | t1    | <null>     | index | <null>        | PRIMARY | 4       | <null> | 3    | 100.0    | Using index |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------+---------------+---------+---------+--------+------+----------+-------------+
```

For InnoDB, a secondary index might cover the selected columns even if the query also selects the primary key because InnoDB stores the primary key value with each secondary index. If key is NULL, MySQL found no index to use for executing the query more efficiently.

- key_len(JSON name: key_length)
The key_len column indicates the length of the key that MySQL decided to use. The value of key_len enables you to determine how many parts of a multiple-part key MySQL actually uses. If the key columns says NULL, the key_len column also says NULL.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(255), age int, key idx(name, age));
INSERT INTO tbl (name, age) VALUES ('a', 1), ('d', 3), ('b', 4), ('f', 10), ('a', 12), ('b', 11);
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE name IN ('a', 'b') AND age BETWEEN 5 AND 10;
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------+---------------+-----+---------+--------+------+----------+--------------------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type  | possible_keys | key | key_len | ref    | rows | filtered | Extra                    |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------+---------------+-----+---------+--------+------+----------+--------------------------+
| 1  | SIMPLE      | tbl   | <null>     | range | idx           | idx | 1028    | <null> | 2    | 100.0    | Using where; Using index |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------+---------------+-----+---------+--------+------+----------+--------------------------+
```

- ref (JSON name: ref)

The ref column shows which columns or constant are compared to the index named in the key column to select rows from the table.

- rows (JSON name: rows)

The rows column indicates the number of rows MySQL believes it must examine to execute the query.

- filtered (JSON name: filtered)

The filtered column indicates an estimated percentage of table rows that are filtered by the table condition. The maximum value is 100 which means no filtering of rows occured. Values decreasing from 100 indicate increasing amounts of filtering. rows shows the estimated number of rows examined and rows x filtered shows the number of rows that are joined with the following table.

- Extra (JSON name:none)

## EXPLAIN Join Types

The type column of EXPLAIN output describes how tables are joined. In JSON-formatted output, there are found as values of the access_type property. The following list describes the join types, ordered from the best type to the worst: 

**- system**
The table has only one row(=system table). This is a special case of the const join type

Example: null

**- const**
The table has at most one matching row which is read at the start of the query(compile time). Because there is only one row, values from the column in this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the optimizer. const tables are very fast because they are read only once.

const is used when you compare all parts of a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE index to constant values. In the following queries, tbl_name can be used as a const table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert a single row into the table
INSERT INTO example_table (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');

-- Query using the "system" join type
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM example_table WHERE id = 1;
```

**- eq_ref**
This join type is used for indexed lookups on unique not null or primary key indexes. It occurs when all parts of an index are used by the join, and only one matching row is expected.

```sql
create table tbl1 (id int auto_increment primary key);
create table tbl2 (id int auto_increment primary key);

explain select * from tbl1 join tbl2 on tbl2.id = tbl1.id;
+----+-------------+-------+------------+--------+---------------+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+----------+-------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type   | possible_keys | key     | key_len | ref                   | rows | filtered | Extra       |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+--------+---------------+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+----------+-------------+
| 1  | SIMPLE      | tbl1  | <null>     | index  | PRIMARY       | PRIMARY | 4       | <null>                | 3    | 100.0    | Using index |
| 1  | SIMPLE      | tbl2  | <null>     | eq_ref | PRIMARY       | PRIMARY | 4       | learn_explain.tbl1.id | 1    | 100.0    | Using index |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+--------+---------------+---------+---------+-----------------------+------+----------+-------------+
```

**- ref**

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl1 (
    id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(255), 
    key idx_name(name)
);

INSERT INTO tbl1 (name) VALUES ('a'), ( 'b') ,( 'c'), ('a'), ('d');

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl1 WHERE name = 'a';
```

**- index_merge**

This join type indicates that the Index Merge optimization is used. In this case, the key column in the output row contains a list of indexes used, and key_len contains a list of the longest key parts for the indexes used.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, a int, b int, key idx_a(a), key idx_b(b));
INSERT INTO tbl (a, b) VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4);

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE a = 1 AND b = 2;
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------+------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type        | possible_keys | key         | key_len | ref    | rows | filtered | Extra                                                  |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------+------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | SIMPLE      | tbl   | <null>     | index_merge | idx_a,idx_b   | idx_a,idx_b | 5,5     | <null> | 1    | 100.0    | Using intersect(idx_a,idx_b); Using where; Using index |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------+------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE a = 1 OR b = 2;
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------+------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type        | possible_keys | key         | key_len | ref    | rows | filtered | Extra                                 |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------+------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| 1  | SIMPLE      | tbl   | <null>     | index_merge | idx_a,idx_b   | idx_a,idx_b | 5,5     | <null> | 4    | 100.0    | Using union(idx_a,idx_b); Using where |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------+--------+------+----------+---------------------------------------+
```

**- unique_subquery**

This type replaces eq_ref for some IN subqueries of the following form:

```sql
value IN (SELECT primary_key FROM single_table WHERE some_expr)
```

**- index_subquery**

**- range**

Only rows that are in a given range are retrieved, using an index to select the rows. The key column in the output row indicates which index is used. The key_len contains the longest key that was used. The ref column is NULL for this type.

range can be used when a key column is compared to a constant using any of the =, <>, >, >=, <, <=, IS NULL, <=>, BETWEEN, LIKE, or IN() operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_column = 10;

SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_column BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
```

**- index**

**- all**

## EXPLAIN Extra Information

The Extra column of EXPLAIN output contains additional information about how MySQL resolves the query.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl (id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, a int, key idx(a));
INSERT INTO tbl (a) VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (1), (2), (3);

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE a = 1;
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+-----+---------+-------+------+----------+-------------+
| id | select_type | table | partitions | type | possible_keys | key | key_len | ref   | rows | filtered | Extra       |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+-----+---------+-------+------+----------+-------------+
| 1  | SIMPLE      | tbl   | <null>     | ref  | idx           | idx | 5       | const | 2    | 100.0    | Using index |
+----+-------------+-------+------------+------+---------------+-----+---------+-------+------+----------+-------------+
```
