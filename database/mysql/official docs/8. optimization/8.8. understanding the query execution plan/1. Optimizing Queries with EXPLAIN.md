# Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN

The EXPLAIN statement provides information about how MySQL executes statements:

- Explain works with SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REPLACE, and UPDATE statement.
- When EXPLAIN is used with an explainable statement MySQL displays information from the optimizer about the statement execution plan. That is, MySQL explains how it would process the statement, including information about how tables are joined and in which order.
- For SELECT statements, EXPLAIN produces additional execution plan information that can be displayed using SHOW WARNINGS.
- EXPLAIN is usedful for examining queries involving partitioned tables.
- The FORMAT option can be used to select the output format. TRADITIONAL presents the output in tabular format. This is the default if no FORMAT option is present. JSON format displays the information in JSON format.
