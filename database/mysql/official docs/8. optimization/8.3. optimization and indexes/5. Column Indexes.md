# Column Indexes

The most common type of index involves a single column, storing copies of the values from that column in a data structure, allowing fast lookups for the rows with the corresponding column values. The B-tree data structure lets the index quickly find a specific value, a set of values, or a range of values, corresponding to operations such as =, >, <=, BETWEEN, IN, and so on, in a WHERE clause.

## Index Prefixes

With col_name(N) syntax in an index specification for a string column, you can create an index that uses only the first N characters of the column. Indexing only a prefix of column values in this way can make the index file much smaller. When you index a BLOB or TEXT column, you must specify a prefix length for the index.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
```

Prefixes can be up to 1000 bytes long (767 bytes for InnoDB tables, unless you have innodb_large_prefix set). 

**Note**

Prefix limits are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix length in CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and
