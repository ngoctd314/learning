# 15. The InnoDB Storage Engine

## 15.1. Introduction to InnoDB

In MySQL 8.0, InnoDB is the default MySQL storage engine.

- Follow ACID model, transaction and crash-recovery
- Row-level locking
- InnoDB tables arrange your data on disk to optimize queries based on primary keys.
- InnoDB support FK constraints.

|Feature|Support|
|-|-|
|Foreign key support|Yes|
|Transactions|Yes|

### 15.1.1. Benefits of Using InnoDB Tables

- If the server unexpectedly exists because of a hardware or software issue. InnoDB has crash recovery
- InnoDB has storage engine maintains its own buffer poll for caches
- If data becomes corrupted on disk or i memory, a checksum mechnism alerts you to the bogus data before you use it.
- When you design a database with appropriate primary key columns for each table, operations involving those columns are automatically optimized. It is very fast to reference the primary key columns in WHERE clauses, ORDER BY clauses, GROUP BY clauses.
