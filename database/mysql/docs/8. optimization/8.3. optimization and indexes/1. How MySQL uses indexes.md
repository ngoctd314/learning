# How MySQL Uses Indexes

Most MySQL indexes (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE INDEX, and FULLTEXT) are stores in B-trees. Memory tables also support hash indexes; InnoDB use inverted lists for FULL TEXT indexes. 

MySQL uses indexes for these operations:

- To find the rows matching a WHERE clause quickly.
- To eliminate rows from consideration. If there is a choice between multiple indexes, MySQL normally uses the index that finds the smallest number of rows.

## 8.3.2. Primary Key Optimization

The primary key for a table represents the column or set of columns that you use in your most vital queries. It has an associated index, for fast query performance. Query performance benefits from the NOT NULL optimization, because it cannot include any NULL values. With the InnoDB storage engine, the table data is physically organized to do ultra-fast lookups and sorts based on the primary key or columns.  

## 8.3.3. SPATIAL Index Optimization

## 8.3.4. Foreign Key Optimization

If a table has many columns, and you query many different combinations of columns, it might be efficient to split the less-frequently used data into separate tables with a few columns each, and relate back to the main table by duplicating the numeric ID column from the main table.

## 8.3.5. Column Indexes

The B-tree data structure lets the index quickly find a specific value, a set of values, or a range of values, corresponding to operators such as =, >, <=, BETWEEN, IN, and so on, in a WHERE clause.

### 8.3.5.1. Index Prefixes

With col_name(N) syntax in an index specification for a string column, you can create an index that use only the first N characters of the column. Indexing only a prefix of columns values in this way can make the index file much smaller. When you create index a BLOB or TEXT column, you must specify a prefix length for the index. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE test(blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
```
