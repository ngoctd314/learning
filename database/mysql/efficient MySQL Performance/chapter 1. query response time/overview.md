# Overview

Performance is query response time.

Query response time is how long it takes MySQL to execute a query. Synonymous terms are: response time, query time, execution time, and (inaccurately) query latency.

Performance increases as query response time decreases. Improving query response time is synonymous with reducing query response time.
