# Preface

To address this need, we believe we must focus on two issues. First, the part of the relation system (called SQL optimizer) that has to decide how to find the required information in the most efficient way, and secondly how the indexes and tables are then scanned. We want to try to put ourselves in the optimizer's place; perhaps if we understood why it might have problems, we might be able to do things differently. Fortunately it is quite surprising how little we really need to understand about the optimizers, but what there is though is remarkably important.
