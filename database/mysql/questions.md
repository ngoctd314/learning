## 1. Disadvantage when use MD5(), SHA1(), UUID() as identify.

- The slow **INSERT** queries because the inserted value has to go in a random location in indexes. This causes page splits, random disk accesses, and clustered index fragmentation for clustered storage engines.
- They slow **SELECT** queries because logically adjacent rows will be widely dispersed on disk and in memory.
- Random values cause caches to perform poorly for all types of queries because they defeat locality of reference, which is how caching works. If the entire dataset is equally "hot", there is no advantage to having any particular part of the data cached in memory, and if the working set does not fit in memory, the cache will have a lot of flushes and misses.

**Beware of Autogenerated Schemas**

Applications that "hide complexity from developers" usually don't scale well. We suggest you think carefully before trading performance for developer productivity, and always test on a realistically large dataset, so you don't discover performance problems too late. 

### Special Types of Data

Some kinds of data don't correspond directly to the available built-in types.

Another example is an IPv4 address. People often use VARCHAR(15) columns to store IP addresses. However, they are really unsigned 32-bit integers, not strings. You can should store IP addresses as unsigned integers. MySQL provides the INET_ATON() and INET_NTOA() functions to convert between the two representations.
