## Aggregate

The functions `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX` and `AVG` are aggreates, each may be applied to a numeric attribute resulting in a single row being returned by the query. (These functions are even more useful when used with the `GROUP BY` clause).

## Distinct

By default the result of a `SELECT` may contain duplicate rows. We can remove these duplicates using the `DISTINCT` key word.

## Order by

ORDER BY permits us to see the result of a `SELECT` in any particular order. We may indicate ASC or DESC for ascending (smallest first, largest last) or descending order.
