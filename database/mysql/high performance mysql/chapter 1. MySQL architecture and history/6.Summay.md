# Summary

MySQL has a layered a architecture, which server-side services and query execution on top and storage engines underneath. Although there are many different plugin APIs, the storage engine API is the most important.

The storage engine has its downsides. Sometimes choice isn't a good thing. InnoDB turns out to be a very good storage engine for something like 95% or more of users (that's just a rough guess). All those other engines usually just make things more complicate nad brittle.
