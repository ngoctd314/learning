# Summary

Query optimization is the final piece in the interlocking puzzle of schema, index, and query design to create high-performance applications. To write good queries, you need to understand schemas and indexing, and vice versa.

Ultimately, it is still about response time, and understanding how queries execute so that you can reason about where the time is consumed. With addition of a few things such as the parsing and optimization process, this is just the next step in understanding how MySQL accesses tables and indexes, which we dicussed in the previous chapter.

In the previous chapters we explained schema optimization and indexing, which are necessary for high performance. But they aren't enough - you also need to design your queries well. If your queries are bad, even the best-designed schema and indexes will not perform well.

Query optimization, index optimization, and schema optimization go hand in hand. As you gain experience writing queries in MySQL, you will learn how to design tables and indexes to support efficient queries. Similarly, what you learn about optimal schema design will influence the kinds of queries you write. This process takes time, so we encourage you to refer back to these three chapters as you learn more.
