# Case Studies

Sometimes it's not about query optimization, schema optimization, index optimization, or application design optimization - it's about all of these practices put together. The case studies in this section illustrate how to approach some design challenges that frequently cause problems for users.

## Building a Query Table in MySQL

Building a queue in MySQL is tricky, and most designs we've seen don't work well when the system experiences high traffic and lots of concurrency. The typical pattern is to have a table that contains several types of rows: rows that haven't been processed, rows in process, and finished rows. One or more worker processes look for unprocessed rows, update them to "claim" them, and then perform the work and update them to mark them as finished.
