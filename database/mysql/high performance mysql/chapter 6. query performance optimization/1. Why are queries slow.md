# Why are queries slow?

Before trying to write fast queries, remember that it's all about response time. Queries are tasks, but they are composed of subtasks, and those subtasks consume time, making them happen fewer times, or making them happen more quickly. Sometimes you might also need to modify a query to reduce its impact on other queries running on the system.

What are the subtasks that MySQL performs to execute a query, and which ones are slow? In general, you can think of a query's lifetime by mentally following the query through its sequence diagram from the client to the server, where it is parsed, planned, and executed, and then back again to the client. Execution is one of the most important stages in a query's lifetime. It involves lots of calls to the storage engine to retrieve rows, as well as post-retrieval operations such as grouping and sorting.

While accomplishing all these tasks, the query spends time on the network, in the CPU, in operations such as statistics and planning, locking (mutex waits), and most especially, calls to the storage engine to retrieve rows. These calls consume time in memory, operations, CPU operations, and especially I/O operations if the data isn't in memory. Depending on the storage engine, a lot of context switching and /or system calls might also be involved.

In every case, excessive time may be consumed because the operations are performed needlessly, performed too many times, or are too slow. The goal of optimization is to avoid that, by eliminating or reducing operations, or making them faster.
