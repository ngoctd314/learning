# Optimizing Specific Types of Queries

## Optimizing COUNT() Queries

The COUNT() aggregate function, and how to optimize queries that use it, is probably one of the top 10 most-misunderstood in MySQL. You can do a web search and find more misinformation on this topic than we care to think about.

### What COUNT() does

COUNT() is a special function that works in two very different ways: it counts values and rows. A value is a non-NULL expression (NULL is the absence of a value). If you specify a column name or other expression inside the parantheses, COUNT() counts how many times that expression has a value.

The other form of COUNT() simply counts the number of rows in the result. This is what MySQL does when it knowns the expression inside the parantheses can neven be NULL.

One of the most common mistakes we see is specifying column names inside the parentheses when you want to count rows. When you want to know the number of rows in the result, you should always use COUNT(*). This communicates your intention clearly and avoids poor performance.
