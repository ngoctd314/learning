# Full-Text searching

Perform keyword searches, which are based on relevance instead of comparing values to each other. Full-text search systems are designed for this purpose.

Full-text searches require a special query syntax. They can work with or without in-dexes. But indexes can speed up the matching. The indexes used for full-text searches have a special structure to help find documents that contain the desired keywords.

The fact that only MyISAM supports full-text search is a serious limitation that makes it a nonstarter for most application, because it's just too painful to deal with table-level locking, data corruption, and crash recovery.
