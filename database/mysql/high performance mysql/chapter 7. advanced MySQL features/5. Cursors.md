# Cursors

MySQL provides read-only, forward-only server-side cursors that you can use only from within a MySQL stored procedure or the low-level client API. MySQL's cursors are read-only because they iterate over temporary tables rather than the tables where the data originated. The let you iterate over query results row by row and fetch each row into variables for further processing. A stored procedure  can have multiple cursors open at once, and you can "nest" cursors in loops.
