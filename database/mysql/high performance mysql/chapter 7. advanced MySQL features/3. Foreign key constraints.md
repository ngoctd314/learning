# Foreign key constraints

Foreign keys aren't free. They typically require the server to do a lookup in another table every time you change some data. Although InnoDB requires an index to make this operation faster, this does't eliminate the impact of those checks.

Still, foreign keys can actually improve performance in some cases. If you must guarantee that two related tables have consistent data, it can be more efficient to let the server perform this check than to do it in your application. Foreign keys are also useful for cascading deletes or updates, although they do operate row by row, so they're slower than multi-table deletes or batch operations.

Instead of using foreign keys as constraints, it's often a good idea to constrain the values in the application. Foreign keys can add significant overhead. We don't have any benchmarks to share, but we have seen many cases where server profiling revealed that foreign key constraint checks were the performance problem, and removing the foreign keys improved performance greatly.
