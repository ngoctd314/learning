# Character Sets and Collations

A character set is a mapping from binary encodings to a defined set of symbols; you can think of it as how to represent a particular alphabet in bits. A collation is set of sorting rules for a character set. MySQL's support for character sets and collations is very full-featured, but it can add complexity, and in some cases it has a performance cost.

## How MySQL uses character sets

Character sets can have several collations, and each character set has a default collation. Collations belong to a particular character set and cannot be used with any other.

MySQL has a variety of options that control character sets. The options and the character sets are easy to confuse, so keep this distinct in mind: only character-based values can truly "have" a character set. Everything else is just a setting that specifies which character set to use for comparisons and other operations.

MySQL's settings can be divided into two classes: defaults for creating objects and settings that control how the server and the client communicate.

### Settings for client/server communication

When the server and the client communicate with each other, they might send data back and forth in different character sets. 

- The server assumes the client is sending statements in the character set specified by character_set_client. 
- After the server receives a statement from the client, it translates it into the character set specified by character_set_connection.
- When the server returns results or error message back to the client, it translates them into character_set_result.
