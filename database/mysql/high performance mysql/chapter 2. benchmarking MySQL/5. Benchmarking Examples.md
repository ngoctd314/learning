# MySQL Benchmark Suite

## sysbench

The sysbench tool can run a variety of "tests" (benchmarks). It was designed to test not only database performance, but also how well a system is likely to perform as a database server. In fact, Peter and Vadim originally designed it to run benchmarks specifically relevant to MySQL performance, even though they aren't actually all MySQL benchmarks. We'll start with some tests that aren't MySQL-specific and measure performance for subsystems that will determine the system's overall limits. Then we'll show you how to measure database performance.

### The sysbench CPU benchmark

The most obvious subsystem test is the CPU benchmark, which uses 64-bit integers to calculate prime numbers up to a specified maximum. We run this on two servers, both running GNU/Linux, and compare the results.

### The sysbench file I/O benchmark

The fileio benchmark measures how your system performs under different kinds of I/O loads. It is very helpful for comparing hard drives, RAID cards, and RAID modes, and for tweaking the I/O subsystem. It emulates how InnoDB uses the disks in some important ways.
