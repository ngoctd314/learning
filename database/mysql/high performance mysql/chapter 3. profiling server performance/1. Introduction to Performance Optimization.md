# Introduction to Performance Optimization

Ask 10 people to define performance and you'll probably get 10 different answers, filled with terms such as "queries per second", "CPU utilization", "scalability", and so on. This is file for most purposes, because people understand performance differently in different contexts, but we will use a formal definition. **Performance is measured by the time required to complete a task.** In other words, performance is response time. This is a very important principle. We measure performance by tasks and time, not by resources. A database server's purpose is to execute SQL statements, so the tasks we care about are queries or statements.

Performance optimization is the practice of reducing response time as much as possible for a given workload.

We find that many people are very confused about this. If you think performance optimization requires you to reduce CPU utilization, for example, you're thinking about reducing resource consumption. But this is a trap. Resources are the to be consumed. Sometimes making things faster requires that you increase resource consumption.

How do you determine which tasks to target for optimization? This is why profiling was invented.

**How Do You Know If MeaSurements Are Right**

If measurements are so important, when what if the measurements are wrong? In fact, measurements are always wrong. In fact, measurements are always wrong. The measurement of a quantity is not the same as quantity itself. The measurements might not be wrong enough to make a difference, but they're wrong. Just be conscious that you're working with measurements, not the actual quantities they represent. As usual, the measurements can be presented in confusing or ambiguous ways, which can lead to wrong conclusions, too.

## Optimization Through Profiling

Profiling is the primary means of measuring and analyzing where time is consumed. Profiling entails two steps: measuring tasks and time elapsed, and aggregating and storing the results so that the important tasks bubble to the top.

We will actually discuss two kinds of profiling: execution-time profiling and wait analysis. Execution-time profiling shows which tasks consume the most time, whereas wait analysis shows where tasks gets stuck or blocked the most.

When tasks are slow because they're consuming too many resources and are spending most of their time executing, they won't spend much time waiting, and wait analysis will not be useful. The reverse is true, too: when tasks are waiting all the time and not consuming any resources, measuring where they spend time executing won't be very helpful. If you're not sure which kind of time consumption is the problem, you might need to do both.
