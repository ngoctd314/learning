# Introduction to Performance Optimization

Ask 10 people to define performance and you'll probably get 10 different answers, filled with terms such as "queries per second", "CPU utilization", "scalability", and so on. This is file for most purposes, because people understand performance differently in different contexts, but we will use a formal definition. **Performance is measured by the time required to complete a task.** In other words, performance is response time. This is a very important principle. We measure performance by tasks and time, not by resources. A database server's purpose is to execute SQL statements, so the tasks we care about are queries or statements.

Performance optimization is the practice of reducing response time as much as possible for a given workload.

We find that many people are very confused about this. If you think performance optimization requires you to reduce CPU utilization, for example, you're thinking about reducing resource consumption. But this is a trap. Resources are the to be consumed. Sometimes making things faster requires that you increase resource consumption.
