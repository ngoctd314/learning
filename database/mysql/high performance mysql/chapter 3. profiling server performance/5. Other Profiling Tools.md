# Other Profiling Tools

We've shown a variety of ways to profile MySQL, the os, and queries. We've demonstrated those that we think you'll find most useful, and of course, we'll show more tools and techniques for inspecting and measuring systems throughout this book.

## Using the USER_STATISICS Tables

Percona Server and MariaDB include additional INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables for object-level usage statistics. There were originally created at Google. They are extremely useful for finding out how much or little the various parts of your server are actually used.

```sql
SHOW TABLES FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA LIKE '%_STATISTICS';

+---------------------------------------------+
| Tables_in_information_schema (%_STATISTICS) |
+---------------------------------------------+
| CLIENT_STATISTICS                           |
| INDEX_STATISTICS                            |
| TABLE_STATISTICS                            |
| THREAD_STATISTICS                           |
| USER_STATISTICS                             |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

We don't have space for examples of all queries you can perform against these tables, but a couple of bullet points won't hurt:

- You can find the most-used and least-used tables and indexes, by reads, updates or both.
- You can find unused indexes, which are candidates for removal.
- You can look at the CONNECTED_TIME versus the BUSY_TIME of the replication user to see whether replication will likely have a hard time keeping up soon.

## Using strace
