# Indexing strategies for high performance

Creating the correct indexes and using them properly is essential to good query performance.

There are many ways to choose and use indexes effectively, because there are many special-case optimizations and specialized behaviors. Determining what to use when and evaluating the performance implications of your choices are skills you'll learn over time.

## Isolating the Column

We commonly see queries that defeat indexes or prevent MySQL fro using the available indexes. MySQL generally can't use indexes on columns unless the columns are isolated in the query. "Isolating" the column means it should not be part of an expression or be inside a function in the query.

For example, there's a query that can't use the index on actor_id

```sql
SELECT actor_id FROM tbl WHERE actor_id + 1 = 5;
```

A human can easily see that the WHERE clause is equivalent to actor_id = 4, but MySQL can't solved the equation for actor_id. It's up to you to do this.

Here's another example of a common mistake

```sql
SELECT ... WHERE TO_DAYS(CURRENT_DATE) - TO_DAYS(date_col) <= 10;
```

## Prefix indexes and index selectivity

Sometimes you need to index very long character columns, which makes your indexes large and slow. One strategy is to simulate a hash index, as we showed earlier in this chapter.

You can often save space and get good performance by indexing the first few characters instead of the whole value. This makes your indexes use less space, but it also makes them less selective.
