# Summary

Indexes (also called "keys" in MySQL) are data structures that storage engines use to find rows quickly. They also have several other beneficial properties that we'll explore in this chapter.

Indexes are cirical for good performance, and become more important as your data grows larger.

Index optimization is perhaps the most powerful way to improve query performance. Indexes can improve performance by many orders of magnitude, and optimal indexes can sometimes boost performance about two orders of magnitide more than indexes that are merely good. Creating truly optimal indexes will often require you to rewrite queries.
