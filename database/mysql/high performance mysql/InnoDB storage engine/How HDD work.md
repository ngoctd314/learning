# Hard disk drive

A hard disk drive (HDD) is a non-volatile storage device that stores and retrieves digital information using rapidly rotating disks coated with magnetic material. Here's basic overview of how a hard disk drive works:

**1. Platters:**

- A hard disk drive consists of one or more flat circular disks called platters. These platters are made of aluminum or glass and are coated with a thin layer of magnetic material.

**2. Read/Write Heads:**

- Each platter has a read/write head that hovers just above its surface. The read/write head is mounted on an actuator arm, which allows it to move across the surface of the platter.

**3. Magnetic Encoding:**

- Information is stored on the platters in the form of magnetic patterns. The surface of each platter is divided into concentric tracks and sectors, and data is encoded by magnetizing small regions of the disk.

**4. Spinning Platters**

- The platters spin at high speeds, typically ranging from 5400 to 15000 revolutions per minute (RPM). The spinning creates an air cushion that allows the read/write heads to float just above the surface without touching it.
