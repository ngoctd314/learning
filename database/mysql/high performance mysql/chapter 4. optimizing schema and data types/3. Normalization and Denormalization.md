# Normalization and De-normalization

There are usually many ways to represent any given data, ranging from fully normalized to fully de-normalized and anything in between. In a normalized database, each fact is represented once and only once. Conversely, in a de-normalized database, information is duplicated, or stored in multiple places.

Example about de-normalized database

|EMPLOYEE|DEPARTMENT||
|-|-|-|
|Jones|Accounting|Jones|
|Smith|Engineering|Smith|
|Brown|Accounting|Jones|
|Green|Engineering|Smith|

The problem with this schema is that inconsistencies can occur while the data is being modified. Say Brown takes over as the head of the Accounting department. We need to update multiple rows to reflect this change, and that's a pain and introduces opportunities for error. To avoid these problems, we need to normalize the table by separating the employee and department entities. This process results in the following two tables for employees.
