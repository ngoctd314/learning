# Choosing Optimal Data Types

**Smaller is usually better.** In general, try to use the smallest data type that can correctly store and represent your data. Smaller data types are usually faster, because they use less space on disk, in memory, and in the CPU cache. They also generally require fewer CPU cycles to process.

**Simple is good.** Fewer CPU cycles are typically required to process operations on simpler data types. For example, integers are cheaper to compare than characters, because character sets and collations (sorting rules) make character comparisons, complicated. Here are two examples; you should store dates and times in MySQL's builtin types instead of as strings, and you should use integers for IP addresses.

**Avoid NULL if possible.** A lot of tables include nullable columns even when the application does not need to store NULL (the absence of a value), merely because it's the default. It's usually best to specify columns as NOT NULL unless you intend to store NULL in them.

It's harder for MySQL to optimize queries that refer to nullable columns, because they make indexes, index statistics, and value comparisons more complicated. A nullable column uses more storage space and requires special processing inside MySQL.

The performance improvement from changing NULL columns to NOT NULL is usually small, so don't make it a priority to find and change them on an existing schema unless you know they are causing problems. However, if you've planing to index columns, avoid making them nullable if possible.

InnoDB stores NULL with a single bit, so it can be pretty space-efficient for sparsely populated data. This doesn't apply to MyIsAM.

MySQL supports many aliases for compatibility, such as INTEGER, BOOL, and NUMERIC. These as only aliases. They can be confusing, but they don't affect performance. If you create a table with an aliased data type and then examine SHOW CREATE TABLE, you'll see that MySQL reports the base type, not the aliased you used.

## Whole Numbers

There are two kinds of number: whole numbers and real numbers (numbers with a factional part). If you're storing whole numbers, use one of the integer types: TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT or BIGINT. These require 8, 16, 24, 32 and 64 bits of storage space, respectively. They can store values from -2^(N-1) to 2^(N-1) - 1, where N is the number of bits of storage space they use.

Integer types can optionally have the UNSIGNED attribute, which disallows negative values and approximately doubles the upper limit of positive values you can store. For example, a TINYINT UNSIGNED can store values ranging from 0 to 255 instead of from -128 to 127.

Signed and unsigned types use the same amount of storage space and have the same performance, so use whatever's best for your data range.

MySQL lets you specify a "width" for integer types, such as INT(11). This is meaningless for most applications: it does not restrict the legal range of values, but simple specifies the number of characters MySQL's interactive tools (such as the command-line client) will reserve for display purposes. For storage and computation purposes, INT(1) is identical to INT(20).

## String types

### VARCHAR and CHAR types

The two major string types are VARCHAR and CHAR. It's hard to explain exactly how these values are stored on disk and in-memory, because the implements are storage engine-dependent. We assume you are using InnoDB and/or MyIsAM.

#### VARCHAR

VARCHAR stores variable-length character strings and is the most common string data type. It can require less storage space than fixed-length types, because it uses only as much space as it needs. The exception is a MyISAM table created with ROW_FORMAT=FIXED, which uses a fixed amount of space on disk for each row and can thus waste space.

VARCHAR uses 1 or 2 extra bytes to record the value's length: 1 byte if that column's maximum length is 255 byes or less, and 2 bytes if it's more. Assuming the latin1 character set, a VARCHAR(10) will use up to 11 bytes or storage space. A VARCHAR(1000) can use up to 1002 bytes, because it needs 2 bytes to store length information.

#### CHAR

CHAR is fixed-length: MySQL always allocates enough space for the specified number fo characters. When storing a CHAR value, MySQL removes any trailing spaces. (This was also true of VARCHAR in MySQL 4.1 and older versions - CHAR and VARCHAR were logically identical and differed only in storage format). Values are padded with spaces as needed for comparisons.

CHAR is useful if you want to store very short strings, or if all the values are nearly the same length. For example, CHAR is a good choice for MD5 values for user pass-words, which are always the same length. CHAR is also better than VARCHAR for data that's changed frequently, because a fixed-length row is not prone to fragmentation. For very short columns, CHAR is also more efficient than VARCHAR, a CHAR(1) designed to hold only Y and N values will use only one byte in a single-byte character set, but a VARCHAR would use two bytes because of the length byte.

#### BLOB and TEXT types

BLOG and TEXT are string date types designed to store large amounts of data as either binary or character strings, respectively.

#### Using ENUM instead of a string type

Sometimes you can use an ENUM column instead of conventional string types. An ENUM column can store a predefined set of distinct string values. MySQL stores them very compactly, packed into one or two bytes depending on the number of values in the list. It stores each value internally as an integer representing its position in the field definition list, and it keeps the "lookup table" that defines the number-to-string corresponding in the table's .frm file.

```sql
CREATE TABLE enum_test (
    e ENUM('fish', 'apple', 'dog') NOT NULL
);
```

Another surprise is that an ENUM field sorts by the internal integer values, not by the strings themselves

```sql
mysql> SELECT e FROM enum_test ORDER BY e;
+-------+
| e     |
+-------+
|       |
| fish  |
| fish  |
| apple |
| apple |
| apple |
| apple |
| apple |
+-------+
```

The biggest downside of ENUM is that the list of strings is fixed, and adding or removing strings requires the use of ALTER TABLE. Thus, it might not be a good idea to use ENUM as a string data type when the list of allowed string values is likely to change arbitrarily in the future, unless it's acceptable to add them at the end of the list, which can be done without a full rebuild of the table.

Because the MySQL stores each value as an integer and has to do a lookup to convert it to its string representation. This is usually offset by their smaller size, but not always. In particular, it can be slower to join a CHAR or VARCHAR column to an ENUM column than to another CHAR and VARCHAR column.

#### Date and Time Types

#### Bit-Packed Data Types

#### Choosing Identifiers

Choosing a good data type for an identifier column is very important.

## Schema Design Gotchas in MySQL

Although there are universally bad and good design principles, there are also issues that arise from how MySQL is implemented, and that means you can make MySQL specific mistakes.

Too many joins
