# Choosing Optimal Data Types

**Smaller is usually better.** In general, try to use the smallest data type that can correctly store and represent your data. Smaller data types are usually faster, because they use less space on disk, in memory, and in the CPU cache. They also generally require fewer CPU cycles to process.

**Simple is good.** Fewer CPU cycles are typically required to process operations on simpler data types. For example, integers are cheaper to compare than characters, because character sets and collations (sorting rules) make character comparisons, complicated. Here are two examples; you should store dates and times in MySQL's builtin types instead of as strings, and you should use integers for IP addresses.

**Avoid NULL if possible.** A lot of tables include nullable columns even when the application does not need to store NULL (the absence of a value), merely because it's the default. It's usually best to specify columns as NOT NULL unless you intend to store NULL in them.

It's harder for MySQL to optimize queries that refer to nullable columns, because they make indexes, index statistics, and value comparisons more complicated. A nullable column uses more storage space and requires special processing inside MySQL.
