**1-1. Why Databases?**

Database evolved from the need to manage large amounts of data in an organized and efficient manner. In the early days, compute file systems were used to organize such data. Although file system data management is now largely outmoded, understanding the characteristics of file systems is important because file systems are the source of serious data management limitations.

Databases are the best way to store and manage data. Databases make data persistent and shareable in a secure way.

**1-2. Data versus Information**

Data consists of raw facts. The word raw indicates that the facts have not yet been processed to reveal their meaning.

Information is the result of processing raw data to reveal its meaning.

Let's summarize some key points.

- Data constitutes the building blocks of information.
- Information is produced by processing data.
- Information is used to reveal the meaning of data.
- Accurate, relevant, and timely information is the key to good decision making.
- Good decision making  is the to organizational survival in a global environment.

Data management is a process that focuses on data collection, storage, and retrieval. Common data management functions include addition, deletion, modfication, and listing.

**Information**

The result of processing raw data to reveal its meaning. Information consists of transformed data and facilitates decision making.

**Summary**

- Data constitutes the building blocks of information.
