# Index and Table Pages

Index and table rows are grouped together in pages; these are often 4K in size, this being a rather convenient size to use for most purposes, but other page sizes may be used. Fortunately, as fas as index design is concerned, this is not an important consideration orther than that the page size will determine the number of index and table rows in each page and the number of pages involved.

Buffer pools and I/O activity (discussed later) are based on pages; for example, an entire page will be read from disk into a buffer pool. This means that several rows, not just one, are read into the buffer pool with a single I/O. We will also see that several pages may be read into the pool by just one I/O.
