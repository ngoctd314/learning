In addition, to the built-in clients, Kafka has a binary wire protocol. This means that it is possible for applications to read messages from Kafka or write message to Kafka simply by sending the correct byte sequences to Kafka's network port. There are multiple clients that implement Kafka's wire protocol in different programming languages, giving simple ways to use Kafka not just in Java.
